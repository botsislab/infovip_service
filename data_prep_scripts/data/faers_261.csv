METABOLIC ACIDOSIS [Metabolic acidosis] 
DIARRHOEA [Diarrhoea]
FEVER [Fever]
VOMITING [Vomiting]
DRUG INTERACTION [Drug interaction]

Case Description:
Initial Report received on 06-Mar-2014: This is a spontaneous report, initially received from the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) on 06-Mar-2014 through the National Pharmacovigilance Network (the case has been included in the network by Local Health Authority: A.O.G.SALVINI-GARBAGNATE and the ministerial code associated to the case is 240914. A Hospital Physician reported about a 66 years old female patient who was born on [RED].

Patient's concurrent illnesses included hypertension arterial and IHD. Concomitant medications included cardioaspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) orally, gastroresistant tablet at the dose of 100 mg for IHD,
quinapril EG film-coated tablet at the dose of 20 mg for hypertension arterial, Janumet film-coated tablet for diabetes mellitus, vytorin tablets, lansoprazole at the dose of 30 mg and simvastatin.

The patient received oral metformin hydrochloride at the dose of 1000 mg daily from 01-Jan-2004 to 26-Feb-2014 for type 2 diabetes mellitus. On [RED], th e patient developed diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, fever and vomiting. The patient underwent hemodialysis, hospitalisation in rianimation and administration of sodium bicarbonate 100 mEq and glucosate solution 5% in response to the event. Laboratory tests on 26-Feb-2014: blood pressure (70/140 mmHg), blood glucose (40 mg/dL, range low value: 60 and high value: 110), fibrin D dimer (1226 mg/dL,range high value: 200), heart rate (85 bpm), lactate (123.6 mg/dL, range low value: 4.5 and high value: 19.8), partial pressure CO2 (16.1 mmHg, range low value: 35 and high value: 45), alveolar oxygen partial pressure (135.7 mmHg, range low value: 80 and high value: 100), glasgow coma scale (15 DF) and blood pH (6.822 DF, range low value: 7.35 and high value: 7.45). The outcome of the events was reported to be recovered.

The outcome of the case was recovered.

The events were assessed as serious ""life-threatening"".

Additional information received from Doc-generic on 10-Mar-2014 with MCN# IT-DOC -140688. Updated event outcome date, treatment and senders comment.

The outcome of the events was reported to be recovered on 28-Feb-2014.

Actions taken regarding the events admission to the intensive care unit, administration of sodium bicarbonate 100 mEq and glucosate solution 5%.

Sender comment:
The only event unlisted is ""Fever"". Lactic acidosis is a serious metabolic complication that can occur due to accumulation of metformin hydrochloride. Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, however, the patient's medical history does not appear to be characterized by impaired renal function. Concomitant drug JANUMET containig metformin could be involved in the acidosis onset. Dechallenge positive could not be confirmed since other treatments could cause the events improvement. No other risk factors are reported. Temporal association events-suspect drug intake is plausib le. Company causality: possible.

Additional information was received from Pfizer a license partner of Aurobindo for Metformin with MCN # 2014067575) on 14-Mar-2014. New information included: Updated Pfizer MCN.

No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

Follow-up (17-Mar-2014): Received from Doc-generici. Additional information received via the Italian Health Authority includes: JANUMET was considered as suspect drug and suspect drugs were considered as interacting. Added drug interaction as new event.

Updated JANUMET from concomitant drug as suspect drug. The patient was taking Janumet 50 mg/1000 mg compresse rivestite con film (sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate and metformin hydrochloride) at 1 df /day orally for diabetes mellitus for 4 years. On an unknown date, the patient had experienced drug interaction.

The outcome of the event drug interaction was recovered on unknown date. The outcome of the case was recovered.

The events were result of drug interac tion between Janumet and metformin however this interaction was not coded as an event. 

The only event unlisted for Janumet is fever. Company casuality events Janumet: possible.

Additional information was received from AIFA on 21-Mar-2014. No new information was reported.

Follow-up (23-Jun-2014): Received from Italian Drug Agency (AIFA). Updated casuality. 

This case was assessed with Naranjo's algorithm on 23-Jun-2014. Causal relationship between the adverse events and the intake of the suspect drugs was assessed as probable by the reporter by means of Naranjo's algorithm.

Lin, et al. Sitagliptin caused acute drug induced interstitial nephritis. Consultant; peer review consultation in primary care monthly magazine; 2014-JUN-12: 54 (6): 444-446.

Information has been received from the authors in a published literature article title as stated above.

A 69-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department because of microscopic hematuria identified in the primary care physician's office, associated with urinary urgency and frequency. These symptoms were progressively worsening for 2 days. The patient had been well until 2 days before this presentation. The patient complained of chills and night sweats, but denied having any fever or arthralgia. His appetite was fair. He reported recently starting sitagliptin (manufacturer unknown) 4 weeks prior to this emergency department visit. He denies any other new prescribed medications or the use of any over-the-counter medication (eg, ibuprofen). Because the patient had a history of nephrolithiasis, an abdominal CT without contrast was performed in the emergency department, which demonstrated mild left perinephric soft tissue stranding-indicating pyelonephritis, but with no evidence of nephrolithiasis.

The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and nephrolithiasis. He also has a history of acute kidney injury secondary to using a medication during his right knee surgery roughly 30 years ago. Renal failure has resolved, but he was unable to recall the name of the medication. The patient has allergies to metformin, which causes diarrhea, and varenicline, which causes depression.

The patient smokes 1 pack-per-day, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not use illicit drugs. His mother is alive with coronary artery disease, but his father is deceased secondary to a brain aneurysm. There is no family history of kidney disease. 

Physical Examination
On physical examination, the temperature was 98.3°F, blood pressure was 140/69 mm Hg, and the pulse was 88 beats per minute with normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of murmur. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with only mild tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrant areas. Bilateral costovertebral angles have no tenderness. The abdomen had no guarding and no rebound tenderness. There were no skin rashes, no joint swelling, and no tenderness on palpation of joints. 

Laboratory Tests
The laboratory tests upon admission were as follows: complete blood count with differential, blood glucose level, total albumin, globulin, and liver function tests were normal. There was no eosinophilia. However, carbon dioxide was 21 mEq/L, blood urea nitrate (BUN) level was 54 mg/dL, creatinine (cr) was 4.95 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 12 mL/min/1.73 m2. 

Four months prior to hospitalization, BUN was 15 mg/dl, creatinine was 1.07 mg/dl, and eGFR was 69 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Urine analysis was hazy with a pH of 6.0, specific gravity 1.009, protein 30 mg/g (high), glucose 100 mg/dl, ketone negative, occult blood small amount, nitrite negative, bilirubin negative, leukocyte esterase negative, red blood count of 1 hpf (high power field), white blood count of 4 hpf, and 8 granular casts. A blood culture was performed which was sterile.

Medication
The patient was taking the following medications at home: amlodipine/valsartan 10/320 mg 1 tablet PO daily, clobetasol 1 application topically twice daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg PO 3 times daily as needed for anxiety, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE) 2 sprays to each nostril daily, sitagliptin(manufacturer unknown) 100 mg 1 tablet PO daily, gemfibrozil 600 mg 1 tablet PO daily, omeprazole 20 mg 1 tablet PO daily, glipizide 10 mg 1 tablet PO twice daily, cetirizine 10 mg 1 PO daily, and aspirin 81 mg 1 tablet PO daily.

Hospital Treatment
The patient was admitted because of acute kidney injury. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started initially because of the possibility of having a urinary tract infection or mild pyelonephritis, which was indicated by the symptoms of microscopic hematuria, dysuria, urgency, as well as right upper and lower abdominal pain. However, urine cultures and blood culture came back negative, bilateral renal ultrasound did not show any abnormality, and the patient had good urine output, as post-voiding limits. Urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and obstructive uropathy were ruled out.

Other laboratory tests results included: 24 hours urine volume 3000 ml, creatinine 24-hours at 1.34 mg/dl, albumin at 20 mg/24 hours, total protein 1770 g/dl, protein/creatinine ratio 1317 mg/g, alpha-1 globulin at 9%, alpha-2 globulin at 33%, beta globulin at 22%, gamma globulin at 15%, and urine protein electrophoresis showing no abnormal peaks detected. Serum cryoglobulins, antinuclear antibody, antiproteinase-3, anti-myeloperoxidase, double strand DNA antibody, and GBM antibody all came back negative. C3 was 165 mg/dl (high), C4 was 35.6 mg/dl, and total complement (CH50) >60 U/ml (high). Hepatitis panel was negative, HIV 1 & 2 antigen and antibody were negative, anti-streptolysin was 47 units/ml, which was within normal limits, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies level was negative. During the hospital stay, eGFR continuously declined. The most extreme BUN was 67 mg/dl, creatinine was 6.28 mg/dl, and eGFR was 9 ml/min/1.73 m2 on the 5th day of admission. A right internal jugular vein temporary dialysis catheter was placed for hemodialysis because of the worsening renal function and a renal biopsy was performed the same day. The patient was suspected of having a sitagliptin-induced acute kidney injury; the sitagliptin(manufacturer unknown) was subsequently discontinued upon admission.

Renal biopsy demonstrated an acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) characterized by interstitial edema and a diffuse mononuclear interstitial infiltrate with numerous eosinophils. Associated tubular epithelial cell damage was present, characterized by nucleomegaly and cytoplasmic basophilia. Immunohistochemical staining showed the mononuclear cells to be predominantly CD3-positive T lymphocytes, as expected in a hypersensitivity-type AIN. There were only sparse CD20-positive B lymphocytes, with polyclonal kappa and lambda light chain staining. There was no granulomatous inflammation.

Other intrarenal etiologies for acute kidney injury such as acute glomerulonephritis, ischemic acute tubular necrosis, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy, cholesterol embolization, and cast nephropathy were all ruled out by the absence of specific morphologic findings. Immunofluorescence studies and electron microscopy further failed to demonstrate evidence of an immune complex-related etiology. There was mild arteriolar hyalinosis, consistent with the history of hypertension as well as diabetes, however there was no evidence of diabetic glomerulopathy or other chronic renal disease. There was no significant interstitial fibrosis or tubular atrophy. 

The patient was discharged home because of improving eGFR on the 7th day of admission.

Follow-Up
Four days after discharging, the patient was readmitted to the same hospital because of recurrent chills and mild fever starting late in the night prior to admission. The patient was not diaphoretic and the patient was given intravenous antibiotics in the emergency room. Patient was found with mild worsening renal function compared to the eGFR when he was discharged. The patient had no dysuria, no hematuria, and still had excellent urine output. At that time, the results of the kidney biopsy confirmed acute kidney injury originated from AIN likely because of the recent medication of sitagliptin(manufacturer unknown). 

The patient was then continued on hemodialysis 3 times per week and prednisone(manufacturer unknown) 60 mg a day was initiated with a tapering dose. At the same time, 2 sets of blood cultures were sent again, which were negative. 

In the office follow-up visit, renal funtion mildly fluctuated but generally continued improving. Three weeks after starting tapering doses of prednisone, his BUN was 36 mg/dl, creatinine was 1.56 mg/dl and eGFR was 44 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Discussion
AIN is considered one of the major causes of reversible acute kidney injury. Drugs are the most common cause of AIN. The true incidence of drug-induced AIN is unknown and probably large numbers of cases remain unrecognized with mild elevations in renal dysfunction. Various drugs can induce AIN; NSAIDs are most frequently the cause among drugs.

Over the last 3 to 4 decades, there has been a changing profile of associated medications. In the 1970s and 1980s, most cases were penicillin-related and associated with typical hypersensitivity symptoms. In the 1990s, etiology
became more diverse and there were less associated symptoms. However, omeprazole has become a common cause of AIN since 1990s.

Diagnosis. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings vary according to the class of drug involved. A definitive diagnosis of AIN can only be established by kidney biopsy. Sometimes diagnosis of drug-induced AIN is made on the basis of clinical presentation and not confirmed with histology. Noninvasive tests, such as gallium scintigraphy and testing for eosinophiluria, are of limited diagnostic utility and may lead to the possibility of an inaccurate diagnosis.

Treatment. The mainstay of therapy for drug-induced AIN is timely discontinuation of the causative agent. Corticosteroid therapy appears to have a positive effect in some patients with drug-induced AIN, especially when treatment is initiated early in the course of the disease. A recent study provides more evidence that steroid treatment has a greater degree of improvement in renal function. Sitaglipin is a widely used oral glucose-lowering medication that acts via the incretin-hormone system. Recent reports demonstrate that the use of sitaglipin generally has not been associated with any appreciable excess risk of all-cause hospital admission or all-cause mortality in a broad-spectrum of patients. There are also reports of the use of sitagliptin associated with AIN 8 Unfortunately, in this report, no kidney biopsy was performed to confirm drug-induced pathology changes. 

Outcome of the case. In this case, the presentation is not classic. There was no history of skin rash, arthralgia, or eosinophilia. Instead, the case presented with hematuria, flank pain, and possible sepsis, which were eventually ruled out.

A temporal relation between AIN, causing renal failure, and exposure to the sitagliptin(manufacturer unknown) was suspected upon admission. The offensive medication was discontinued. The patient was started on steroids after the pathology report, and renal function was greatly improved in the following 1 month. Patient has been on omeprazole for at least 5 years prior to this episode of acute kidney injury. Omeprazole has been continued during and after the onset of AIN. Therefore, there is not any tempospacial evidence of omeprazole as a medication which could have caused the AIN in this case.
The data suggests that the abovementioned presentation of sitagliptin (manufacturer unknown)-causing AIN can be very atypical, but possible.
New evidence supports that steroid treatment results in improvement in renal function, and that it is reasonable to start steroids for the treatment of drug-induced AIN when the result of final kidney biopsy is not available.

Additional information was received from literature authors via company representative. It was reported that the unspecified patient mentioned in the article, had no renal failure prior to being prescribed sitagliptin (manufacturer unknown, could not be ruled out JANUVIA). Upon being prescribed sitagliptin (manufacturer unknown) and taking it for 4 days on an unspecified date, the patient experienced nephritis.

On 08-Sep-2014, aspartate aminotransferase was 50 IU/L, glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) 121 IU/L, blood alkaline phosphatase 508 IU/L, and Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) 394 IU/L. On 06-Oct-2014, aspartate aminotransferase was 21 IU/L, GPT 27 IU/L, blood alkaline phosphatase 270 IU/L, and GGTP 139 IU/L. 

The patient's medical history included appendicitis.

Reporter causality assessment: The event was related to dapagliflozin therapy.

Supplemental information received from the physician via Ono Pharmaceutical via AstraZeneca on 28-Nov-2014 included the following: The event hepatic function disorder was reported to be medically significant event.

On 08-Apr-2014, dapagliflozin 5 mg once daily was started for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (previously reported as 16-Apr-2014). On 08-Apr-2014, lab test data revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 26 IU/L (Normal range: 13 to 33), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 33 IU/L (Normal range: 6 to 30), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 508 IU/L (Normal range: 115 to 359) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (G-GTP) at 157 IU/L (Normal range: 10 to 47). 

On 28-Apr-2014, hepatic steatosis developed, and appendicitis was aggravated. On 26-May-2014, lab test data revealed AST at 28 IU/L, ALT at 37 IU/L, ALP at 273 IU/L and G-GTP at 84 IU/L.

Concomitant medication: Digoxine (Hemigoxine Nativelle®), fluindione (Previscan®), doxépine (Quitaxon®), sitagliptine (Januvia®), Domperidone Arrow®, Econazole Sandoz® - long term treatments.

On [RED], the patient was admitted to hospital for dyspnea in a context of over-infection for 15 days, treated initially by pristinamycine (Pyostacine®) (no otherwise specified), then by clarithromycin (brand name or generic: unknown). On admission, a chest X-ray revealed interstitial syndrome suggesting left ventricular insufficiency.

Etiology research was in favour of multi-organ failure with hypercapnic respiratory acidosis (pH at 7.26 and PCO2 à 79 mmHg), cardiac failure with NT-proBNP at 6962 (unit not specified), renal failure with creatinine at 166 µmol/l and infectious syndrome with CRP peaking at 278 mg/l. Urine test evidenced infection to E. Coli.

On 14-Oct-2014, antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone Mylan® and metronidazole B Braun® was initiated. As well as treatment with spironolactone (Aldactone®), furosemide (Lasilix®) and pantoprazole Actavis®.
On 16-Oct-2014, initiation of treatment with oxazepam (Seresta®), haloperidol (Haldol®), cetirizine Arrow® and macrogol association (Movicol®).
On 18-Oct-2014, maculopapular eruption occurred on the upper body. Ceftriaxone was stopped and switched to Levofloxacine Mylan®. 
On 20-Oct-2014, eruption spread and blisters appeared on the anterior side of the upper body, associated to a painful phlyctenular eruption on the back. Treatment with morphine was introduced.
The following medications were stopped: metronidazole B Braun®, levofloxacine Mylan®, aldactone®, Lasilix®, pantoprazole Actavis®, Seresta®, cetirizine Arrow®.

On 21-Oct-2014, after dermatologist consultation, Lyell syndrome was diagnosed. This would have required transfer of the patient in intensive care unit. Since the patient was clinically much deteriorated and the prognosis of this pathology was life-threatening, the family refused the transfer. The patient was managed in palliative care.
On [RED], the patient died.

The reporter assessed this case as serious - fatal outcome.

Case reference number BD-2014-0151 is a literature case report received on 19-Dec-2014, from the article entitled, ""Intestinal obstruction in pregnancy by ondansetron"", published in the journal entitled, Reproductive Toxicology.


The article was based on a case of a pregnant woman with severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy who developed intestinal obstruction after being treated with ondansetron.


The patient is # 1 of 2 total patients. Reference linked case BD-2014-0152 and BD-2014-0154.
On an unknown date, a 29 year old female patient received an oral varying dosage of ondansetron (4-8mg) for hyperemesis gravidarum for a continuous period of 3 months prior to hospitalization. The patient has a medical history of migraines that ceased at 6 weeks gestation and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Severe nausea and vomiting started in the early stages of the patient's pregnancy and later developed into hyperemesis gravidarum. At twenty-one weeks of gestation the patient began experiencing extreme abdominal pain that worsened within half an hour. The patient was admitted into the hospital with severe vomiting. Electrolytes, complete blood count, thyroid function, and liver function tests were normal. The diagnosis of intestinal obstruction was established based on physical assessment and an ultrasound. At this time ondansetron was discontinued. Enteral nutrition and intravenous fluids were avoided until patient's full recovery. The patient delivered a healthy male infant at week 41 of pregnancy with no birth defect or complications. The infant was delivered weighing 3865g with Apgar score at 1 minute of 9 and at 5 minutes Apgar score of 10. It was reported that the baby had a normal development to age 2 years.

Gut motility disorders might occur as a consequence of acute pancreatitis, peritonitis, ischemia, trauma or electrolyte disorders. All of these conditions were ruled out in this case. Another condition effecting intestinal peristalsis is thyroid disease. Although the patient's medical history included adiagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis, her thyroid function was stable with levothyroxine. Furthermore, the patient had neither history of bowel disease nor did she consume other drugs affecting bowel movement except from ondansetron. The drug's monograph includes a warning about intestinal obstruction due to its effect on large bowel transit time. Since defecation is affected both by bowel movement and hydration, a possible mechanism might be a combination of low intestinal peristalsis, caused by ondansetron and dehydration related to hyperemesis gravidarum.

As intestinal obstruction is very rare during pregnancy (it ranges from 1 in 1500 to 1 in 66,000 deliveries), we assumed that this adverse event was not related to the woman's gestational state, but rather mediated locally by 5-HT3 receptors in the colon. Ondansetron antagonizing effect on these receptors prolongs colonic transit time. Therefore, it is probably more likely to occur while administrating the drug orally. The spontaneous reporting system of WHO confirms that this potentially life threatening complication is more common than what the peer review literature may suggest and needs to be looked into carefully, especially in view of the wide spread off-label use for NVP. In conclusion, this serious adverse effect of ondansetron is probably much more common, and has been the subject of underreporting.

The manufacturer considers the events of intestinal obstruction to be serious due to the patient being hospitalized.

Intestinal Obstruction [Intestinal obstruction]

Case Description:
Case reference number BD-2014-0152 is a literature case report received on 19-Dec-2014 from the article entitled, ""Intestinal obstruction in pregnancy by ondansetron"", published in the journal entitled, Reproductive Toxicology.

The article was referenced from another article based on a case of a pregnant woman with severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy who developed intestinal obstruction after being treated with ondansetron. A case of intestinal obstruction while consuming ondansetron was also reported in a 26 year old man treated with ondansetron.

The patient is # 2 of 2 total patients. Reference linked case BD-2014-0151.

A 26 year old male patient received ondansetron as an antiemetic agent associated with cancer chemotherapy. Intravenous treatment of 8 mg ondansetron was initially given followed by oral administration. The patient developed intestinal obstruction and was hospitalized due to this event on day 14 of treatment. Ondansetron was discontinued and restarted orally a few months later, causing a second episode of intestinal obstruction.

The manufacturer considers the event of intestinal obstruction to be serious due to the patient being hospitalized. The manufacturer considers the event of intestinal obstruction as unexpected.

This case was referenced out of another article entitled, ""Recurrent bowel occlusion with oral ondansetron with no side effects of the intra-venous route: a previously unknown adverse event."" Lebrun, C. et al. Ann Oncol 1997;8(9):919-920.

Follow -up information received 30-Dec-2014 from an article entitled, ""Recurrent bowel occlusion with oral ondansetron with no side effects of the intra-venous route: a previously unknown adverse event"" which was referenced in the article entitled ""Intestinal obstruction in pregnancy by ondansetron.""

In January 1991, a 26-year-old man presented partial epileptic seizures which, on brain CT scan and MRI, revealed an infiltrating process. Stereotaxic biopsy showed a left parietal low-grade glioma. Epilepsy was stabilized by oral carbamazepine (1200 mg/qd) and oral phenytoin (100 mg t.i.d.). He had no personal or familial history or bowel disorder. In November 1994, partial epileptic seizures recurred. Brain MRI showed a marked enhancement of the tumor site. A second stereotaxic biopsy confirmed an anaplastic astrocytoma. The convulsions were stabilized by oral carbamazepine (1200 mg/qd), oral phenytoin (100 t.i.d.) and vigabatrin (1 g t.i.d.) without clinical or biological side effects. Malignant anaplastic astrocytoma was treated by whole brain irradiation (50 Gy with a local boost of 10 Gy, ending in January 1995). In April 1995, the patient presented intracranial hypertension which was treated by oral methylprednisolone (80 mg/qd). Brain MRI revealed considerable enhancement and chemotherapy was begun (2 courses of PCV: vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 i.v., dl-d29; oral CCNU: 110 mg/m2, d2; oral procarbazine, 60 mg/m2, d7 to d21). The patient took no drugs narcotics for pain control nor any other medications. Antiemetic medication contained 8 mg of ondansetron given intravenously 30 min prior to chemotherapy. This anti-emetic treatment was not sufficient and, for the second course, 8 mg of ondansetron (b.i.d.) d2-dl4 were given orally. The patient was hospitalized for bowel occlusion on day 14. He had complained of constipation since d2, the condition was confirmed by abdominal X-ray, and ondansetron was discontinued. Abdominal CT scan was performed to exclude a bowel tumor or a Turcot syndrome and transit returned to normal within four days with symptomatic treatment (trimebutine i.v. 100 mg/d).

The patient suffered a new episode of abdominal occlusion after ondansetron was initiated. Please reference BD-2014-0154.

Die Eltern der 10-j?hrigen Patientin bemerkten, dass ihre Tochter in der Nacht auf den [RED] aus nicht ersichtlichen Gr?nden sehr schlecht schlafen konnte. Um 7 Uhr morgens hat der Vater ihr eine 8mg Tablette Zofran? (Ondansetron) gegeben, worauf die Patientin eingeschlafen ist. ?blicherweise verwenden sie eine 4mg Einzeldosis bzw. 6mg dreimal t?glich seit dem 06.05.2014. Um 7:25Uhr verliess der Vater das Zimmer. F?nf Minuten sp?ter wollte die Mutter ihrer Tochter weitere Medikamente verabreichen, sah dann aber, wie die Tochter mit ihrem linken Arm am Kopf und offenen Augen im Bett lag. Ihre Tochter habe sich nicht bewegt und reagierte nicht auf Ansprache der Mutter. Die Eltern haben den Blutdruck der Patientin gemessen und konnten sich nur noch an einen systolischen Wert von 145mmHg erinnern. Daraufhin fuhren sie mit ihrer Tochter, die weiterhin unansprechbar und schlapp war, in ein Spital. Die Patientin machte keinerlei spontane Bewegungen, ihre Augen waren aber stets ge?ffnet. Die Eltern verneinten einen vermehrten Speichelfluss oder Zungenbiss. Die Patientin wurde nach Ankunft im Krankenhaus in ein Kinderspital ?berwiesen. Dort in der Notfallaufnahme angekommen, kam die Patientin wieder zu sich, habe anfangs aber wie ein Roboter gesprochen und sich zeitweise auf die falsche Seite gewandt, um ihre Mutter anzusehen. Bis zum 31.05.2014 sei der Allgemeinzustand der Patientin stabil gewesen und zu einem Vorfall wie diesem war es noch nie gekommen. Das Serumkreatinin der Patientin betrug 38 umol/l und das Albumin 19g/L. XDie junge Patientin leidet an einer Beta Thalass?mia major.

Im Rahmen einer rezidivierenden akuten, transienten Pankratitis bei intestinaler Graft-versus-Host-Reaktion wurde eine Immunosuppressions- bzw. Immunomodulations-Therapie eingeleit. Eine extracorporale Photopherese wurde ebenfalls durchgef?hrt. Es kam weiter zu diversen infektiologischen Komplikationen, und die Patientin entwickelte eine arterielle Hypertonie, Schilddr?senunterfunktion, schwere Ern?hrungsst?rung mit inadequater Kalorienzufuhr und Stimmungsschwankungen.

At 7 o'clock in the morning the father has given one  tablet Zofran ? (ondansetron) 8mg, whereupon the patient is asleep. Typically, they use a single dose of 4mg and 6mg three times a day since 06.05.2014. At 7:25, the father left the room. Five minutes later the mother wanted to give her daughter further drugs, but then she saw that the daughter lay in the bed with her left arm on the head and eyes wide open. Their daughter was not moving and did not respond to the mother who spoke to her. The parents have measured the blood pressure of the patient and could remember only a systolic value of 145 mmHg. Then they drove with their daughter, who was still not responsive and flabby, in a hospital. The patient does not  move spontaneously, but her eyes were always open. The parents denied an increased flow of saliva or tongue bite. The patient was referred after arrival at the hospital in a children's Hospital. Having arrived in the emergency room, the patient was again responsive, but talked initially like a robot and temporarily looked to the wrong side to see her mother. Until 31.05.2014 the general condition of the patient was stable and there had never been an incident like this. The patient's serum creatinine was 38 umol/l and the albumin 19 g/L. X The young patient suffers from Beta thalassemia major. In August 2013 she received a blood stem cell transplantation after which complications occurred in the course. In the context of a recurrent acute, transient pancreatitis in case of intestinal Graft-versus-host reaction an immunosuppression respectively immunomodulation therapy was started. An extracorporal photopheresis was also carried out. In the course further infectious complications occurred and the patient developed an arterial hypertension, hypothyroidism, severe nutritional disorder with inadequate caloric intake, and mood swings.

X - XSENDERS COMMENT further: X The maximum single dose for children aged from 6 months to 17 years is 8 mg, ideally 0.1-0.2mg/kg/dosage 2-4 x daily. It was therefore not an overdose, however, the dose was double or one-quarter higher than usual. Additionally, drug interactions with the concomitant medication of the patient and an additive CNS depressive effect cannot be ruled out. X Summarizing we assess, due to very close and also from a pharmacokinetic perspective plausible temporal correlation and good documentation in the drug databases on the one hand,, on the other hand, at the same time taken other drugs, which can trigger a CNS depressive effect, and the possibility of alternative, non-medicamentous causes, the causality between a taking Zofran ? and clouding of consciousness according to WHO/CIOMS criteria formally as possible.

The active ingredient of Zofran ? ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which suppresses nausea and vomiting. X In this case the patient takes other medicines such as Atarax ? (hydroxyzine), an ethanolic cannabis tincture, Durogesic (fentanyl) and Actiq ? (fentanyl), which can cause a depression of the CNS, but the occurrence of clouding of consciousness shortly after taking the drug suggests here a relationship with Zofran ?. The US American drug database Micromedex ? describes the occurrence of somnolence and sedation under ondansetron with an incidence rate of 8%, and also extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as an oculogyric crisis, in conjunction with other dystonic reactions, are listed as possible side effects. Also the result of a search in the WHO database could provide a further indication of a relationship with Zofran ?. In this database, currently 62 cases of stupor (WHO-ART) under Zofran ? are reported between 1991 and 2014. X The peak plasma concentration of ondansetron is reached approximately 1.5 hours after ingestion. Therefore, the occurrence of clouding of consciousness of the patient approximately 30 minutes after taking 8 mg seems plausible from a pharmacokinetic perspective. The half-life in children aged 3-12 years is 2.9 hours, here also compatible with the gradual decline of symptoms after 3 hours. Clearance as well as distribution volume increase in this patient group depending on the body weight and reach at the age of 12 years that of young adults.",06/1/2014,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS,DISTURBANCES IN CONSCIOUSNESS NEC,NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS NEC,NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS,,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS,06/01/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,"HO,OT",ZOFRAN(PS),ONDANSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE(PS),ONDANSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE(PS),Zofran,ACTIQ:ADALAT (NIFEDIPIN):AMPHO MORONAL:ANTRAMUPS:ATARAX:BALDRIAN:BUDENOFALK:BUSCOPAN:CALCIUM CARBONATE:CANNABIS SATIVA SUBSP.

This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer on 06-Jan-2015 (reference number: PPD 1-94XOVG).

A 62-year-old Caucasian male patient started therapy with Entyvio (vedolizumab) 300 mg intravenous infusion on an unknown date in 2014 for the treatment of Ulcerative colitis.

The current conditions of the patient included high blood pressure, reflux and immune system disorder. The concomitant medications included blood pressure medication, steroids, vitamin C and Prilosec.

On 21-Oct-2014, the patient received second dose of Entyvio and on 18-Nov-2014 received third dose of Entyvio.

On [RED], the patient's lab values revealed hemoglobin of 6.6 (serious event). It was not reported why the patient had lab values drawn, however he was admitted to the hospital on that day. During hospitalization, the patient's hemoglobin dropped down to 6.3. The patient was treated with three units of blood. Before discharge, the patient's hemoglobin came up to 7.8. On [RED], the patient was discharged. On approximately 30-Dec-2014, the patient's hemoglobin was found to be 9.3.

At the time of reporting, it was unknown if the treatment with Entyvio was ongoing.

The outcome of the event was recovering.

The reporter did not provide causality assessment between the adverse event and Entyvio.

An health care professional (HCP) follow up letter was sent to the address provided by the patient, but the HCP had no record of patient experiencing any adverse event during or resulting from Entyvio infusion.

Additional attempts have been made to reach the health care professional. No further information is expected.

This spontaneous case was reported by a physician from Takeda Sweden (reference number: SE-01693).

A male patient of an unknown age and ethnicity, started therapy with Entyvio (vedolizumab) (dosage, form and route: unknown) on an unknown date, for an unspecified indication.

The historical condition included stable liver function test prior to start of Entyvio and concurrent condition included primary sclerosing cholangitis since over 10 years. The concomitant medication was not reported.

It was reported that since start of Entyvio therapy, the patient had liver function test abnormal and Hepatitis (non-infectious) (serious events). No treatment was reported. The physician did not consider the elevated liver enzyme levels unusual as the patient had primary sclerosing cholangitis since over 10 years and mentioned that it could be due to natural fluctuation but a liver biopsy has been planned later in Feb-2015. The physician expected to have a final conclusion in mar-2015 and would then reassess Entyvio treatment.

At the time of report, it was unknown if the therapy with Entyvio was ongoing. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

The physician did not provide the causality between the events and Entyvio.

Company Comment: The available information is insufficient to assess causality between the events and drug administered. The case is confounded by the patient's diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

No follow up information is expected but the physician has promised to provide DSO with the outcome of the investigation once it has been completed. Case is closed.

This spontaneous case was reported by a Physician via a company representative (reference number: LOC FI-00708).

The case refers to a 39-year old male, the patient who experienced spondylodiskitis, epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, condition deteriorated with diarrhea for a week, some of it bloody, mild fever, common cold ,periodontitis and cerebellar infarction, while receiving Entyvio (vedolizumab). It was reported that, the patient was waiting to be operated and did not want a total colectomy yet. 

The relevant medical history included an injury to neck while playing ice hockey in Oct-2014. The neck injury was a whiplash caused by hitting the boards with no actual direct trauma to the head or neck, the pain had been present all the time since then and was treated symptomatically. The concurrent conditions included patent foramen ovale, depressive symptoms and sleep loss due to private life problems.

The concomitant medications included escitalopram, mirtazapine, etoricoxib and mesalazine (before the onset of infection). The physician provided that none of these medications have contributed to the events.

On 29-Nov-2014, the patient started Entyvio 300 mg intravenous infusion, for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

On an unknown date, after receiving a first Entyvio infusion, the patient underwent root treatment due to sore tooth and was given two regimens of antibiotics. On an unknown date, between the first and second Entyvio infusions, the patient had a tooth removed due to periodontitis (non-serious event). It was unclear whether the condition was present prior to treatment initiation. 

On 12-Dec-2014, the patient was given second infusion of Entyvio. It was reported as the intestinal symptoms alleviated and the patient was happy with his condition. On 30-Dec-2014, the C-reactive protein (CRP) was 71 (units not reported). 

On [RED], the patient came to the ECU (emergency care unit) because the patient's condition deteriorated, with diarrhea for a week, some of it was bloody (serious event).The symptoms were first thought to be caused by a Crohn's flare, complicated by infection (or vice versa). The CRP was 254 on 05-Jan-2015, which was not typical for the flares he had previously experienced and the patient was not given the third infusion. The patient also experienced mild fever, common cold (non-serious events). At ward, the patient was treated with Cortisone, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg x2 per oral, Metronidazole 500 mg x3 per oral, Piperacillin plus tazobactam 4 g x3 i.v (intravenous) and Solu plus Medrol 40 mg + 20 mg i.v. The CRP went down rapidly and was 57, on 08-Jan-2015. The patient was discharged with antibiotics. Corticosteroid was discontinued at this point.

On 09-Jan-2015, the patient was diagnosed with neck stiffness, spondylodiskitis (serious event) and epidural abscess (serious event), at the out-of-hours services. On 10-Jan-2015, initial CT scan (computed tomography) was performed and the abscess was seen on the C1-C3 level. On 11-Jan-2015, MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) revealed osteomyelitis (serious event) in the C2 vertebral corpus and also the blood culture showed only the growth of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. As Saccharomyces Cerevisiae was the baking yeast it was unlikely to be the causative microbe. The initial cultures before the start of any antimicrobial therapy were negative. The patient was treated with a combination of wide-spectrum antimicrobial medication, including antimycotic agents (Piperacillin plus Tazobactam, vancomycin, rifampicin, Cancidas). According to the neurosurgeon, it was not possible to drain the abscess, therefore no samples from the focus itself were available. Finally, on [RED], a decompressive laminectomy was also performed due to intense pain.

The patient was slowly recovering. The main cause for a lengthened stay at the ICU ( intensive care unit) was the intense neck pain which was treated with ketamine, dexmedetomidine, pregabaline, hydromorphone, ketorolac and paracetamol. It was unclear whether the neck trauma was in the same region as the abscess because there were no actual traumatic findings in the CT and MRI scans. The patient was discharged from the ICU on [RED] and stayed in the infectious disease ward until [RED]. Follow-up visits were now performed at the outpatient ward, current medications were levofloxacin, hydromorphone (12 mg/day, down-titration ongoing), pregabaline, mirtazapine (previous medication), paracetamol, warfarin, enoxaparin and salazopyrin.

The patient also had a cerebellar infarction (serious event) and was on antithrombotic medications. This was seen in the MRI scan done on 14-Jan-2015 and was probably caused by a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale, for which a closing procedure was planned.

At the time of reporting, it was unknown if the treatment with Entyvio was ongoing.

The outcome of events bloody diarrhea, periodontitis, mild fever, common cold and cerebellar infarction were not reported and the outcome of other events (Epidural abscess, Spondylodiskitis and osteomyelitis) was recovering.

According to the physician, it was possible that the whiplash may have caused minor intervertebral disc injury. It was conceivable that this, in turn, could have predisposed to infection, which was finally caused by the bacteremia due to dental infection. The role of vedolizumab in these events, if any, remains unclear.

Company-comment:
Based on the available information, a causal relationship between the serious events reported in this case drug infusion cannot be established.

The patient's concomitant medication included Ferrograd. The patient's medical history included iron deficiency anemia and creatinemia at 51 umol/l. The patient's previous ARV treatment included Atripla (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) which was discontinued in Jan 2013 due to nightmares (MCN# 2014-0119159).

In Aug 2013, after commencing treatment with emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the patient experienced convulsion and recurrence at the beginning of January 2014 and mid-February 2014. 

On [RED], the patient presented with recurrence of seizure (third episode). On the same day, the patient was hospitalized due to recurrence of malaise with loss of consciousness, stertorous breath for around 3 minutes, followed by a post critical confusion for around 30 min with temporo-spatial disorientation without loss of urine or tongue bite. The patient also presented with generalized stiffness, staring and retroactive amnesia. On an arrival at emergency, the patient was conscious and oriented without sign of neurologic localization. Cerebral scan was normal. The patient was transferred to internal medicine unit. 

The patient's laboratory results showed CRP at 19 mg/l (reference range not specified), white blood cells at 1800 (units and reference range not specified), neutrophils at 620/mm3 (reference range not specified), lymphocytes at 870/mm3 (reference range not specified), Hb at 12.5 g/dl (reference range not specified), mean corpuscular volume at 88.9 fl (reference range not specified), platelets at 137000/mm3 (reference range not specified), ferritin at 44,6 ug/l (reference range not specified), CD3 at 709/mm3 (reference range not specified), CD4 at 341/mm3 (reference range not specified), CD8 at 356/mm3 (reference range not specified), undetectable plasmatic RNA viral load. Hepatic work was normal and urinary strip test was negative. CMV serology showed positive IgG, toxoplasmosis serology showed positive IgG.

On [RED], the patient's electroencephalogram showed traces rather well structured and some left theta temporal irregularities were noted (post critical appearance).

On [RED], the patient's cerebral MRI showed normal appearance without encephalitis sign or other anomaly.

On [RED], the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was clear as crystal, limpid macroscopic aspect, of colorless color and no element, and showed glucose at 2.9 g/l (glycemia at 4.3 mmol/l), cerebrospinal fluid proteins at 0.32 g/l, lactic acid at 1.2 mmol/l. red blood cells at 2 and negative culture.

Cryptococcal soluble antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid were negative at the direct, negative culture; mycobacteria test was negative at the direct. Pneumococcus soluble antigens were negative in the cerebrospinal fluid. Anapathology on the cerebrospinal fluid showed nearly acellular liquid, no sign of inflammation or suspect cells were noted. Cerebral scan showed no notable anomaly.

The patient started treatment with Keppra and treatment with emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was continued. At the time of this report, the outcome of the event of convulsion was reported as unknown. 

The patient's clinicians concluded - recurrent seizure, probably of iatrogenic origin.

The reporter assessed the events of convulsion as serious (hospitalization). The French imputability of Eviplera reported as C1 S1 I1. 

Follow up information received from Janssen on 14 Mar 2014: No new information received.

Follow up information received from authority on 13 Oct 2014: The patient's concomitant medication and reason for discontinuation of Atripla were received. The patient's laboratory results, action taken with Eviplera and treatment details were received. This information has been incorporated into the case.

Follow up information received from Janssen on 21 Oct 2014: No new information received (acknowledgement of receipt and reference number only).

Follow-up information was received from the French authority on 31 December 2014: Per consultation report dated 13 November 2014, the patient experienced new generalised convulsive criss on 07 November 2014 (fourth crisis within 15 months) despite treatment with Keppra 250 mg BID.

This is a report from Non-Interventional study for Study ID: FOS02S based on information received by Pfizer from Nobel pharma (Manufacture control number: FOS140078), license party for fosphenytoin (FOSTOIN). 
A physician reported that a 63-year-old female patient started to receive fosphenytoin sodium (FOSTOIN, Solution for injection). On 27Feb2014 the patient received first dose of Fosphenytoin Sodium at 18 mg/kg (28 mg/min in 0.9% physiological saline in 1:8.9) via an unspecified route of administration for prevention of epileptic seizures following neurosurgery. On 28Feb2014 the patient received second dose of Fosphenytoin Sodium at 7.5 mg/kg (11.8 mg/min in 0.9% physiological saline in 1:21.3) and on 01Mar2014 the third dose at 7.5 mg/kg (11.8 mg/min in 0.9% physiological saline in 1:21.3). Relevant history included uterine leiomyoma, hypertension, glioma, convulsion (3 episodes per year of non-convulsive unspecified attack of unconsciousness). Concomitant medications included spironolactone (ALDACTONE-A) 25mg oral from before administration of fosphenytoin and ongoing after administration of fosphenytoin for complication; Maintate (bisoprolol,-fumarate) 2.5mg oral from before administration of fosphenytoin and ongoing after administration of fosphenytoin for complication; Norvasc OD (amlodipine besilate) 5mg oral from before administration of fosphenytoin and ongoing after administration of fosphenytoin for complication. Approximately 5 days later on 05Mar2014 the patient developed symptomatic epilepsy. On 10Mar2014 the patient developed pulmonary embolism. The seriousness criteria for these events were hospitalization. The subject underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood pressure (Normal), Blood pressure (Normal), Blood pressure (Normal), Cardiac function test (Normal), Cardiac function test (Normal), Cardiac function test (Normal). The action taken with product Fosphenytoin Sodium was permanently withdrawn on unknown date. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Jun2014 for pulmonary embolism and recovering for symptomatic epilepsy. On an unknown date, the subject was discharged from the hospital. The investigator considered that the relationship of the event to treatment with Fosphenytoin Sodium was unrelated. Evaluation of efficacy: unevaluable (reason: although details are unknown, epilepsy occurred after administration of Fosphenytoin).

This case was reported by a physician, via a sales representative, and
described the occurrence of triple-vessel coronary thrombosis in a 38
year-old female patient who received dolutegravir (Tivicay) and abacavir +
lamivudine (Kivexa) for human immunodeficiency virus infection. 





The patient was resistant to raltegravir (Isentress).


Co-suspect medications included atazanavir (Reyataz) and ritonavir (Norvir).





First antiretroviral treatment included emtricitabine + tenofovir (Truvada) +
Reyataz + Norvir but treatment had to be stopped due to virologic failure and
renal disorders.


On 02 February 2014, treatment was switched to Kivexa (one tablet daily) +
Tivicay (two tablets daily) + Reyataz + Norvir.


Early in March 2014, Reyataz + Norvir were stopped. The patient continued
Kivexa + Tivicay.


On an unspecified date, the patient complained of thoracic pain and
esophageal pain.


On 17 June 2014, i.e. approximately four months after starting Tivicay +
Kivexa, endoscopy was performed and revealed triple-vessel coronary
thrombosis. 


On [RED], the patient underwent open heart surgery as angioplasty was
not possible.





Action taken with antiretroviral treatment was not specified.





At the time of reporting, the outcome was unknown.





Causality assessment of the reporting physician was unknown.





Follow up information received on 07 July 2014 from the French Regulatory
Authority (ANSM reference TS20140406) and from the physician (both follow-up
were processed together):


The patient had no cardiovascular family history.


Co-suspect medications also included atazanavir (Reyataz) and saquinavir
(Invirase).


Concomitant medications included ritonavir (Norvir), iron (Tardyferon) and
pantoprazole (Eupantol).


The patient had been treated with Invirase at 1000 mg twice daily, Isentress
at 1 tablet twice daily and Norvir at 100 mg twice daily for at least 8
months.


In February 2014, this treatment was stopped due to virologic failure
(raltegravir resistance mutations). The patient was started on Tardyferon.


The patient had the following cardiovascular risk factors: cholesterol total
was at 2.3 g/L (normal lower than 2 g/L) but low density lipoprotein
cholesterol was normal at 1.47 g/L and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
was normal at 0.5 g/L.


In February 2014, the patient was started on Kivexa (oral) + Tivicay (two
tablets daily) + Reyataz + Norvir for one month in order to decrease the HIV
viral load.


Early in March 2014, Reyataz + Norvir were stopped. The patient continued
Kivexa + Tivicay.


In May 2014, the patient experienced chest pain; cardiovascular examination
was normal (nos) and no etiology was found after three consultations. The
patient was started on Eupantol for a possible gastroesophageal reflux.


In mid -[RED], as the symptoms were persisting, the patient was
hospitalized. She was diagnosed with triple-vessel coronary atheroma and
coronary thrombosis requiring surgery.


Treatments with Kivexa and Tivicay were continued (inconsistent data - the
ANSM reported that Kivexa and Tivicay were discontinued). The physician
planned to switch Kivexa by Truvada.


At the time of reporting, the events coronary artery thrombosis and coronary
atheroma were resolved with sequelae and the event thoracic pain was
resolved. 


According to the ANSM, based on the French method of assessment, the events
coronary artery thrombosis, coronary atheroma and thoracic pain were unlikely
related to Tivicay and/or Kivexa.


The reporting physician suspected that the events were related to cumulative
exposure to protease inhibitors.

She did not experience liver disorder with other statin or fibrate therapy. She was not a drug abuser and was a social drinker. The patient did not receive concomitant medications including nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and salicylate and Chinese herbal medicines. She did not take health foods, either. On 12-Feb-2014, oral Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 20 mg once daily for reflux oesophagitis and oral Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) were newly started when the patient visited a nearby hospital complaining of heavy stomach feeling. On 13-May-2014, both drugs were discontinued and switched to oral Livalo (pitavastatin calcium) once daily for hyperlipidaemia and oral Pariet (sodium rabeprazole) for reflux oesophagitis because worsening tendency of liver disorder was noted, which was suspected to be drug-induced. On 13-May-2014, fulminant hepatitis (preferred term: hepatitis fulminant) developed. On 06-Jun-2014, further aggravation of the liver disorder was noted and all medications were discontinued. In mid Jun-2014, the patient experienced jaundice and inappetence. Severe liver disorder was diagnosed because decreased prothrombin time (PT) was noted. No pyrexia or abdominal pain developed. In Jun-2014, nausea developed. Neither liver biopsy nor ultrasonography was performed. Other examinations including virus marker tests were performed. On[RED], the symptoms including jaundice and malaise were recognised. Laboratory data showed severe liver disorder: T-bil 21.1, D-bil 15.8, AST 354, ALT 411, PT 33.7%, and Plt 10 x 104. The patient was admitted to hospital. On 03-Jul-2014, hepatic coma developed, and the patient was transferred to the reporting hospital with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis. Plasma exchange (PEX) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) were performed for a total of five times (through 07-Jul-2014) and seven times (through 09-Jul-2014), respectively. On 03-Jul-2014, the patient was tested negative for all of the followings: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis A (HA)-IgM, cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM, C7HRP, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-IgM, and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb). On 07-Jul-2014 Drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium hydrate): - Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium): On Unknown date Hepatitis virus: Negative.On 07-Jul-2014, prednisolone was started at 60 mg. On 08-Jul-2014, hepatic coma improved to grade II from grade IV. Subsequently, prednisolone tapered, and the ammonia level improved and the level of consciousness became favourable. However, as the improvement in the clotting function and jaundice was poor, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was continued on an as-needed basis. On 17-Jul-2014, the fulminant hepatitis was improving. On [RED], as the clotting function did not improve enough, liver transplant from a brain-dead donor was performed.On [RED], as the patient made a favourable postoperative progress, she was discharged.  The patient recovered from the event of hepatitis fulminant on 08-Oct-2014.According to the reporter the adverse event of fulminant hepatitis was considered to be serious with the serious criteria of life threatening. The TCS company physician considered the event  fulminant hepatitis/worsening tendency of liver disorder to be serious with serious criteria of hospitalisation.In the subsequent follow-up event verbatim updated to hepatitis fulminant from  fulminant hepatitis/worsening tendency of liver disorder and was considered to be serious with the serious criteria of life threatening onlyThe reporter considered the causality between the event fulminant hepatitis with the suspect drug of Nexium and Crestor to be related.[Additional reporter comment] It was presumed that the patient probably had pre-existing mild liver disorder due to the factors including hepatic steatosis. However, the liver disorder was rapidly aggravated after the start of Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium hydrate) and Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) in Feb 2014. Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium hydrate) and Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) were considered as the suspect drugs since there was no other drug used concomitantly and the patient had no other contributing factor of liver disorder. Further, hepatitis virus test results were negative. Considering the facts and the clinical course, either drug-induced liver disorder or autoimmune hepatitis triggered by the drugs was suspected.Summary of follow-up information received by AstraZeneca/MedImmune 09-Jul-2014 from physician: indication of the suspect drugs were added, action taken for Crestor was changed from unknown to discontinued, stop date of Crestor was added and narrative was updated.Summary of follow-up information received by AstraZeneca/MedImmune on 10-Jul-2014 from a physician: event onset date was amended, patient details were added, Nexium action taken was changed from unknown to discontinued, Nexium dosage was added, Crestor start date was added, stop date amended.Summary of follow-up information received by AstraZeneca/MedImmune on 18-Jul-2014: event term of fulminant hepatitis was updated as fulminant hepatitis/worsening tendency of liver disorder, seriousness criteria of disability/incapacity was deleted for the event of fulminant hepatitis/worsening tendency of liver disorder, patient information updated, laboratory values added, onset date of the event updated, event outcome updated, stop dates of the suspected drugs updated, relevant history of tha patient updated, narrative updated.Summary of follow-up information received by AstraZeneca/MedImmune on 19-Aug-2014 form physician: The start date updated for the Crestor and Nexium.

The patient developed acute pancreatitis on [RED], which required hospitalization. On [RED], the patient was hospitalized for general deterioration with 10 kg weight loss and persisting hyperglycemia. It was reported that ""HI (high)"" message appeared on the display screen for several days. The patient reported having drunk only Coca Cola during the previous days. On admission, there were signs of dehydration, hyperglycemia and pain in right hypochondrium region associated with cutaneo-mucous jaundice. Laboratory work-up revealed cholestasis associated with acute renal failure and increased blood lipase: 104 IU/L. He was also detected with hypotension managed by fluid replacement with 3L. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed on [RED] and revealed serious acute pancreatitis, Balthazar grade E, with pancreatic liquefactive necrosis without collection or infection associated with a not previously detected abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4 cm, partially thrombosed, involving both renal arteries. Treatment with insulin (unspecified trade name) was started and the patient was transferred into the intensive care unit. All chronic medications were interrupted. From [RED] to [RED], the patient's stay in the intensive care unit was with severe hypotension requiring administration of noradrenaline for 24 hours. Surgery was not indicated considering the pancreatic condition and given the aneurysm. From [RED] to [RED], management in the high dependency unit was continued, and then the patient was transferred into the internal medicine unit. Renal function normalized with favorable course of pancreatitis. Oral antidiabetic agents and antihypertensive drugs were not resumed. The patient underwent tests with results which included on [RED]: creatinine 160 umol/l, calcium 2.15 mmol/l, glucose 9.5 mmol/l, lipase 1.3 times the upper normal limit (UNL), aspartate transaminase (AST) normal (N), alanine transaminase (ALT) N, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 13.8 UNL, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 51 UNL, total bilirubin 42 umol/l, conjugated bilirubin 30 umol/l, prothrombin ratio 100 %, liver ultrasound showed bile ducts dilation (common bile duct 9 mm); on 13Mar2014: creatinine 79 umol/l, glucose 24 mmol/l, lipase N, AST N, ALT N, ALP 7.2 UNL, GGT 30 UNL, total bilirubin 39 umol/l, conjugated bilirubin 30 umol/l; on 17Mar2014: creatinine 42 umol/l, glucose 10.1 mmol/l, lipase N, AST N, ALT N, ALP 4.2 UNL, GGT 17 UNL, total bilirubin 31 umol/l, conjugated bilirubin 14 umol/l. On 19Mar2014, fatty liver without evidence of cirrhosis, resolved bile ducts dilation (5 mm), no gallbladder sludge, no biliary lithiasis. Atorvastatin calcium, sitagliptin, gliclazide, isradipine, valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide and celiprolol were discontinued on 12Mar2014. The acute pancreatitis resolved on an unspecified date. Based on the Official French Method of Causality Assessment, all suspected medicinal products sitagliptin/ metformin hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium, sitagliptin, gliclazide, isradipine, valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide and celiprolol were rated by the agency as doubtful.

The report concerns a 74 year old, female patient (height: 168 cm; weight: 67 kg).The patient had diabetes type II for the last 17 years. The patient had osteoporosis history. Concomitant medications included losartan and amlodipine for hypertension and vildagliptin for diabetes type 2. The patient started the treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, losartan and amlodipine prior to diagnosis of diabetes.  In 2012 the patient started treatment with oral Omeprazole (omeprazole) 20 mg, every morning as stomach protector and with oral Kombiglyze (metformin, saxagliptin), 5/1000 mg, daily for diabetes type II. She was also treated with non-AstraZeneca hydrochlorothiazide (hydrochlorothiazide) 25 mg daily started many years ago for hypertension. In 2012, the patient fell down (preferred term: fall) and fractured her right femoral head (preferred term: femur fracture). Due to this, the patient was hospitalized in order to undergo insertion of prosthesis. She was discharged and after that, she has used a walker. After one month, she recovered from this event. In Apr-2014, the patient started experiencing decompensated diabetes (preferred term: diabetes mellitus). Due to this, in May-2014 her physician has switched Kombiglyze 5/1000 mg to oral Forxiga (dapagliflozin) 10 mg, every day, Meritor (metformin) 4/1000 mg, daily and vildagliptin two times daily. Her glycemia level was controlled (about 99-120 mg/dl). The first day of Forxiga use, she took a tablet by morning and experienced a hypoglycemia (preferred term: hypoglycaemia) episode and for this reason experienced dizziness (preferred term: dizziness). The patient informed her physician, who oriented to switch the administration time for lunch time. This day, due to stresscaused to hypoglycemia, she experienced high blood pressure (preferred term: hypertension), reaching 180x110mmH which was considered as lack of effect (preferred term: drug ineffective) for hydrochlothiazide. After this, the blood pressure returned to normal and it was not necessary any alteration in drug.  Action taken with Omeprazole, Forxiga, Meritor and hydrochlorothiazide was unknown. The patient recovered from the events of right femoral head fracture and fall during 2012 and from the events of decompensated diabetes, episode of high blood pressure, episode of hypoglycemia and dizziness during May-2014.Seriousness assessment: right femoral head fracture was assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability and episode of high blood pressure due to medical importance. The remaining adverse events were assessed as non-serious.

A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 33 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, 1X) for Multiple Sclerosis from 24 May 2014 to 24 May 2014 was hospitalized from [RED] to [RED] for bacterial sepsis (onset 30 May 2014), gram-negative bacteremia (onset 30 May 2014), fluctuating fever (onset 29 May 2014), and immune system disorder (onset unknown). The patient also experienced nausea (onset unknown), diarrhea (onset unknown), pain (onset unknown), splenomegaly (onset 30 May 2014), and thrombocytopenia (onset 21 May 2014). The patient had been hospitalized and discharged for MS relapse two weeks prior to the hospitalization in this case. The reason for the current hospitalization was persisting sequelae (decrease of visual acuity, increasing scotoma, urinary incontinence, numb hands, and orgasmic disorder) of the MS relapse. As differential blood count was normal and residual impairment (loss of visual acuity) from the previous [MS] relapse, it seemed justified by the neurologist to switch treatment from fingolimod to TYSABRI even after less than two months in between. The date of the last dose of fingolimod was not reported. The first and only dose of TYSABRI was administered on 24 May 2014. On 29 May the patient experienced a peak of fever (40.6 degrees centigrade) accompanied by leukocytopenia and a slight increase of CRP (0.65 mg/dL on 21 May 2014, 11.09 mg/dL on 31 May 2014, 10.15 mg/dL on 13 Jun 2014 and 0.49 mg/dL on 25 Jun 2014; normal range: less than 0.5 mg/dL). The level of GGT was 27 IU/L on 21 May 2014, 332 IU/L on 31 May 2014 and 142 IU/L on 20 Jun 2014 (normal range: 10-39 IU/L). The level of GPT was 30 IU/L on 21 May 2014, 204 IU/L on 31 May 2014 and 35 IU/L on 20 Jun 2014 (normal range: 10-35 IU/L).  The level of GOT was 135 IU/L on 21 May 2014, 21 IU/L on 24 May 2014 and 29 IU/L on 20 Jun 2014 (normal range: 10-35 IU/L). The level of leukocyte count was 7800 cells/uL on 21 May 2014, 18300 cells/uL on 08 Jun 2014, and 8200 cells/uL on 20 Jun 2014 (normal range: 4400-11300 cells/uL).  The level of lymphocyte was 434 cells/uL on 30 May 2014 (normal range not provided). The level of thrombocyte count was 158000 cells/uL on 21 May 2014, 111000 cells/uL on 31 May 2014, 151000 cells/uL on 20 Jun 2014 and 208000 cells/uL on 25 Jun 2014 (normal range: 215000 - 379000 cells/uL). The level of procalcitonine on an unknown date was normal. On 30 May 2014 procalcitonine was markedly increased (10 ng/ml; normal range: less than 0.5 ng/ml) and the patient had developed a severe bacterial sepsis. The patient's body temperature was measured as feverish on several occasions: 40.6 degrees Celsius on 29 May 2014, 38.4 degrees Celsius on 04 Jun 2014 and 07 Jun 2014 and continued fever between 08 and 10 Jun 2014 although not higher than 39 degrees Celsius. Concomitant medication included Valoron solution (naloxone plus tilidine, PO, as needed), Dipidolor solution for injection (piritramide 5 mg, SC, as needed), and Temgesic forte (buprenorphin, SL, BID, as needed) for pain which the patient had taken for several years until 03 Jul 2014. Additional concomitant medication included L-dopa (62.5 mg, QD, PO) since 2012. Treatment included forced administration of fluid (crystalloid solution), vancomycin for a short time and Meronem (meropenem 1g, IV, TID) from 30 May 2014 to 06 Jun 2014 and Ciprobay (ciprofloxacin 500 mg, PO, BID) from 06 Jun 2014 to 07 Jun 2014 for bacterial sepsis. Additional treatment included ceftriaxone (2g, IV, QD) was given from 07 Jun 2014 to 10 Jun 2014 for confirmed gram-negative bacteremia of Providencia alcalifaciens and Roseomonas gilardii, ceftazidime (2.2 g, IV, BID) from 10 Jun 2014 to 18 Jun 2014 and Meronem (meropenem 1g, IV, TID) from 18 Jun 2014 to 22 Jun 2014 for fever of unknown origin (no more bacteria in the blood), levofloxacin (250 mg, PO, BI) from 22 Jun 2014 to 29 Jun 2014. MRIs on 29 May 2014 and 23 Jun 2013, respectively, did not show any new lesions. The outcome for the events elevated GGT, elevated GPT, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia is unknown. The events of bacterial sepsis, gram-negative bacteremia, immune system disorder, nausea, diarrhea, and pain are resolved. The event fluctuating fever was resolved with sequelae (not specified). The causality for events bacterial sepsis, gram-negative bacteremia, immune system disorder, fluctuating fever, nausea, diarrhea, pain, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia was assessed as possibly related.  The causality for the events elevated GGT and elevated GPT was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 28 Nov 2014: Follow-up information including another copy of the discharge letter was provided by the neurologist. The patient's medical history included a prolonged healing process associated with adhesions following hemi-colectomy due to carcinoid in 2003; and multiple consecutive abscesses of the abdominal wall following cholecystectomy in 2006. According to the patient, she experienced anaphylactic reactions to paracetamol and penicillin. She had not received prior treatment with TYSABRI in the past. The total number of TYSABRI infusions was not provided. Regarding the reported events, the patient was hospitalized from [RED] to [RED] as previously reported. The patient developed a severe sepsis with unknown origin/focus but with evidence of a systemic infection. Laboratory examinations showed presence of the pathogens Providencia alcalifaciens and Roseomonas gilardii. Providencia alcalifaciens was detected in blood cultures on 29 May 2014 and on 30 May 2014; and Roseomonas gilardii was detected in blood cultures on 30 May 2014. 

Subsequent to empirical therapy with meropenem and vancomycin as well as extensive fluid substitution, the patient started to recover from the severe sepsis. During the following days, the patient's body temperature and the laboratory infection parameters decreased. In the further course, the patient's antibiotic therapy was adapted to ciprofloxacine according to microbial sensitivity tests. On this therapy the patient again showed high fever and increase in C-reactive protein and leukocyte count. Therapy was changed to ceftazidine and the patient's symptoms improved, but could not completely be controlled. Therefore, meropenem was re-introduced and subsequently fever and infection parameters normalized. The patient completely recovered from the bacterial sepsis on 25 Jun 2014.  The physician confirmed that thrombocytopenia already had occurred prior to initiation of TYSABRI therapy. The patient had constantly showed mild fluctuating thrombocytopenia with thrombocyte counts around 180 /nl since 02 May 2014. After initiation of TYSABRI, the patient's thrombocytopenia worsened. Thrombocyte count on 30 May 2014 was 85 /nl. Increase in GPT and GGT first occurred on 29 May 2014. Increase in GPT completely resolved on 19 Jun 2014, but subsequently the GPT values fluctuated around the upper normal range of 35 U/l; the last follow-up examination was on 17 Jul 2014. Increase in GGT completely resolved on 17 Jul 2014. The normal ranges of the lymphocyte count were 25-40 per cent.

The neurologist assessed the causality between the increase in GPT and GGT and the treatment with TYSABRI as not related. The patient did not receive treatment for increase in GPT and GGT, but the values were extensively monitored. GOT values were 21 U/l on 21 May 2014 and 23 U/l on 02 May 2014, but were not determined on 24 May 2014 (discrepant from previous report), and on 20 Jun 2014. The physician reported that this case was discussed with an infectious disease specialist but he did not provide further details. The patient did not suffer from sequelae in consequence of the fever, but from sepsis with prolonged fluctuating fever over the following three weeks.",05/1/2014,SEPTICEMIA GRAM-NEGATIVE:GGT INCREASED:SPLENOMEGALY:NAUSEA:GPT INCREASED:THROMBOCYTOPENIA:PAIN:IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDER:DIARRHOEA,ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED:BACTERIAL SEPSIS:DIARRHOEA:GAMMA-GLUTAMYLTRANSFERASE INCREASED:IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDER:NAUSEA:PAIN:SPLENOMEGALY:THROMBOCYTOPENIA,"DIARRHOEA (EXCL INFECTIVE):LIVER FUNCTION ANALYSES:SPLEEN DISORDERS:PAIN AND DISCOMFORT NEC:IMMUNE AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS NEC:SEPSIS, BACTERAEMIA, VIRAEMIA AND FUNGAEMIA NEC:THROMBOCYTOPENIAS:NAUSEA AND VOMITING SYMPTOMS","GASTROINTESTINAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:HEPATOBILIARY INVESTIGATIONS:SPLEEN, LYMPHATIC AND RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM DISORDERS:GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY AND DEFAECATION CONDITIONS:GENERAL SYSTEM DISORDERS NEC:IMMUNE DISORDERS NEC:INFECTIONS - PATHOGEN UNSPECIFIED:PLATELET DISORDERS",BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS:GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS:INVESTIGATIONS:GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS:INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS:IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS,,BACTERIAL SEPSIS,05/30/2014,IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDER,,GAMMA-GLUTAMYLTRANSFERASE INCREASED,05/29/2014,ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED,05/29/2014,NAUSEA,,DIARRHOEA,PAIN,SPLENOMEGALY,THROMBOCYTOPENIA,,,,Y,"HO,LT,OT",TYSABRI(PS),NATALIZUMAB(PS),NATALIZUMAB(PS),TYSABRI,DIPIDOLOR:L-DOPA:TEMGESIC FORTE:VALORON,TYSABRI,NATALIZUMAB,TYSABRI,,,PS,,,,300,MG,,INTRAVENOUS INFUSION,IV,,,,5/24/2014,5/24/2014,1, ,-23,,BLA,125104,,,TILIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE,TILIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE,VALORON,,,C,,,,,,,SOLUTION FOR INJECTION,PO,,,,,7/3/2014,, ,,,,,,,PIRITRAMIDE,PIRITRAMIDE,DIPIDOLOR,,,C,,,,5,MG,,,SC,,,,,7/3/2014,, ,,,,,,,,,TEMGESIC FORTE,,,C,,,,,,,,SL,BID,,,,7/3/2014,, ,,,,,,,L DOPA,LEVODOPA,L-DOPA,,,C,,,,63,MG,,,PO,QD,,,1/1/2012,,, ,851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 18 July 2014, the subject came in for study visit (month 9). During the visit, he reported that he had no complaints and declined study medication, citing lack of HIV risk after separation from his partner. He also expressed willingness to resume at a later time if needed.

Follow-up information received on 07 OCtober 2014: Response to query stating that the information requested will be provided once it is available. No new information, no changes to the case.

Follow-up information received on 31 December 2014:

The study site communicated that the postmortem report for this participant has not been obtained and is not expected, due to the participants family being unwilling to provide it. The site does not anticipate obtaining any further information regarding this event.

Individual family members had considered the possibility that the participant may have committed suicide, noting social stressors, though the site described this as speculation about what may have happened, and it is unclear if these family members had access to the postmortem report. 

The final site assessment is that the cause of death is unknown and cannot be determined.

This case report was received from Insight trials via Merck.

A clinical investigator reported that a 52-year-old Black male patient was hospitalized due to dizziness of unknown etiology and abdominal pain while enrolled in the above mentioned study involving therapy with atazanavir sulfate, ritonavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In addition, the patient experienced syncopy with collapse (syncopy and collapse) which was considered medically significant. 

The patient was consented and underwent initial screen for START on 18-Apr-2013 but failed to return to clinic to enroll in study. He was screened second time on 28-Aug-2013 and enrolled in the START study on 13-Sep-2013. He was randomized and started antiretroviral therapy (ART) on 18-Sep-2013 and received oral therapy with atazanavir sulfate at a dose of 300mg once daily, oral therapy with ritonavir at a dose of 100 mg once daily and oral therapy tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine once daily.   

There was at least one episode of syncope on 04-Aug-2014 reported by the patient, without significant injury. The patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with complaints of a weeks dizziness and passing out. He was admitted on [RED] with a diagnosis and reason of syncope and collapse. He had recently started on citalopram hydrobromide and takes buprenorphine hcl + naloxone hcl chronically. A urine toxicology panel was positive for cocaine hcl, benzodiazepines and hamamelis virginiana. He was admitted to a medical bed. The telemetry was unremarkable and was discontinued. Intravenous fluids (IVF) were administered. 

The patient was initially started on antibiotics for a presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) but they were stopped when his urine culture did not grow anything. He had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showing progressive atrophy and white matter disease but no new lesions. While hospitalized, he complained of severe abdominal pain during admission requiring narcotics for control. His lipase was normal. He felt better on  [RED] with no further spells and was discharged with a short course of oxycodone hcl + acetaminophen. No etiology for the dizziness or syncopy was discovered. He was hyperglycemic with glucose 337. He was also mildly anemic, with hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.8. He was taking amlodipine 5mg tablet, metoprolol succinate 100mg tablet, morniflumate 0.4mg, all of which had side effects of dizziness. Finally, he had positive toxicology urine while also taking buprenorphine hcl + naloxone hcl. All of these could be contributing factors to dizziness and syncopy. The ART was not believed to be related.

At the time of the report, therapy with atazanavir sulfate, ritonavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine were ongoing and the event dizziness of unknown etiology was resolving.

The patients medical history included HIV (human immunodeficiency virus infection), Hepatitis C, Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus type 2 uncontrolled with complications, history of UTI, urinary retention, chronic pancreatitis, patient nonadherence, abdominal pain, chronic generalized gait abnormality, benign lipomatous neoplasm of skin and subcutaneous tissue of left arm, hypokalemia, poly substance abuse.

The investigator considered the event dizziness of unknown etiology to be probably not related to atazanavir sulfate, ritonavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine therapies.

The baby's mother had history of smoking which was stopped in 2012 (please refer mother case PHHO2014IT013727). The baby's mother did not have any chronic or ongoing medical conditions prior to pregnancy, and did not have family history of congenital abnormalities/birth defects or other significant pregnancy complications. 

The baby's mother had first sign/symptom of MS (multiple sclerosis) on 15 Mar 2006 and had last 2 MS relapses on 27 Oct 2008 and 11 Mar 2011 and was noted with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

The baby's mother started study medication on 11 Sep 2007. On 17 May 2013, treatment with study medication was interrupted because the baby's mother planned to become pregnant. The mother's EDSS score (pre-pregnancy) was noted as 1.0 on 17 Sep 2013.

On an unspecified date, the mother becomes pregnant. Last menstrual period of mother was reported as 05 Jan 2014. It was reported that there was no failure of contraception. Prenatal ultrasound performed on 16 Feb 2014 which showed normal confirmation of fetus.  

Expected date of delivery was reported as  [RED] based on last menstrual period calculation method. 

On an unspecified date, the baby was delivered via cesarean section. At the time of this report, baby details were pending. After delivery, the baby was admitted in neonatal ICU (intensive care unit) related to abdominal and chest pressure, a diagnosis was not provided. On  [RED], one day after delivery, the baby died due to respiratory insufficiency due to abdominal pressure. No autopsy was performed. The investigator stated that the exact cause of death was unknown.

The investigator reported the event as serious (fatal). In the absence of investigator's seriousness, Novartis safety physician considered cardiac malformation as serious (congenital anomaly).

The investigator did not suspect a causal relationship between the events and study medication.

DRESS syndrome [DRESS syndrome] HEPATIC CYTOLYSIS [Hepatic cytolysis] skin eruption [Skin eruption]

Case Description:
This case was reported by a regulatory authority and described the occurrence of dress syndrome in a 27-year-old female patient who received abac 6ir sulphate, lamivudine (Kivexa) film-coated tablet for hiv infection

Co-suspect products included levetiracetam (Keppra) unknown for convulsion, darunavir (Prezista) film-coated tablet for hiv infection, ritonavir (Norvir) film-coated tablet for hiv infection and sulphadiazine (Adiazine) tablet for cerebral toxoplasmosis. The patient's past medical history included hepatic cytolysis (unknown cause), appendectomy and miscarriage. Concurrent medical conditions included paludism and cerebral toxoplasmosis. Concomitant products included pyrimethamine (Malocide) and calcium folinate (Lederfoline).

On 10th June 2014, the patient started Kivexa (oral) at an unknown dose and frequency. On 19th May 2014, the patient started Keppra (oral) 500 mg twice daily (1000 mg daily). On 10th June 2014, the patient started Prezista (oral) 800 mg at an unknown frequency and Norvir (oral) 100 mg at an unknown frequency. On 19th May 2014, the patient started Adiazine (oral) 500 mg at an unknown frequency. On 24th June 2014, 14 days after starting Kivexa and an unknown time after starting Keppra, the patient experienced dress syndrome (serious criteria GSK medically significant and clinically significant/intervention required) and hepatic cytolysis (serious criteria GSK medically significant and clinically significant/intervention required). On an unknown date, the patient experienced skin eruption. Kivexa was discontinued on 24th June 2014 (Dechallenge was positive). Keppra was discontinued (Dechallenge was positive). Prezista was discontinued (Dechallenge was positive). Norvir was discontinued (Dechallenge was positive). Adiazine was discontinued (Dechallenge was positive). On 26th June 2014, the outcome of the skin eruption was recovering/resolving. On an unknown date, the outcome of the dress syndrome and hepatic cytolysis were recovered/resolved.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the dress syndrome, hepatic cytolysis and skin eruption to be related to Kivexa and Keppra.


Additional comments:

Treatment with Kivexa was stopped and switched to Truvada and Keppra was discontinued.
On 26 June+2014, skin eruption was improved. Treatment with Malocide, Adiazine,''Lederfoline was discontinued. Treatment with Norvir and Prezista was switched to Isentress. The outcome of liver workup was favourable.

In August 2014, treatment with Malocide was reintroduced without liver cytolysis relapse.

Diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was suggested. A VRESS (virus reactivation with eosinophils and systemic symptoms) was also suspected because of similar literature case published in 2014 by Almudimeegh and Al.

This report concerns a 42-year-old female patient from Japan who was enrolled in RA0105 (#ra15-cimzia 2 mg syringe for subcutaneous injection drug use results survey). 

The patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, ventricular septal defect and schizophrenia. The patient had no allergy, but had been smoking for 20 years. Hepatic and renal function was reported to be normal at the treatment start. The patient had no experience of biological drug use.

Concomitant medications included Mobic and Prednisolone. 

On 07-May-2014, the patient started therapy with Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) at a dose of 400 mg every 2 weeks subcutaneously for rheumatoid arthritis until 04-Jun-2014. On 18-Jun-2014, the dose of certolizumab pegol was reduced to 200 mg every 2 weeks.

Co-suspect medication included Rheumatrex (methotrexate sodium) initiated on 07-May-2014 at an unspecified dose orally for rheumatoid arthritis. 

On 27-Aug-2014, last dose of certolizumab pegol was administered.

On 05-Sep-2014, the patient had a chill and headache.

On 06-Sep-2014 the patient had onset of the event pneumocystis pneumonia. On  [RED], the patient visited the reporting hospital. The body temperature was 39.1 degrees C. Chest X-ray test and CT scan showed diffuse ground glass opacity and pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was suspected. Discontinuation of therapy with methotrexate and certolizumab pegol was determined, and the patient was transferred to another hospital. On the same day, steroid pulse therapy and administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination were started. Subsequently, the patient's condition promptly improved (beta-D glucan was 300 or higher), white blood cell count was performed and the results were 12700 /mcl (normal: 3900 - 8800) and c-reactive protein (CRP) was 1 mg/dl (normal: 0  0.5). 

On 20-Sep-2014, beta-D glucan was 1156 pg/ml (normal: 0  20), CRP was 0.3 mg/dl, KL-6 was 724 IU/ml (normal: 0  499) and white blood cell count was 13300 /mcl.

Treatments of the adverse event were as follows: Prednisolone injection at the dose of 125 mg/day (from 06-Sep-2014 to 08-Sep-2014), 80 mg/day (from 09-Sep-2014 to 11-Sep-2014), 40 mg/day (from 12-Sep-2014 to 13-Sep-2014); oral prednisolone 30 mg/day (from 14-Sep-2014 to 16-Sep-2014), 20 mg/day (from 17-Sep-2014 to 19-Sep-2014), 10 mg/day (from 20-Sep-2014, ongoing); oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination 9 tablets/day (from 06-Sep-2014, ongoing); methylprednisolone sodium succinate injection 125 mg/day on 06-Sep-2014; and cefazolin sodium hydrate injection 1 g/day on 06-Sep-2014.

On 17-Sep-2014, the patient was started on Famotidine D at a dose of 20 mg daily orally for an unknown indication. 

On  [RED], the event was resolving and the patient was discharged.

At the time of report, the event was resolving and therapy with methotrexate and certolizumab pegol remained discontinued, and the patient was placed on follow-up.

Reporter's causality assessment: Related (to both suspect drugs). Other etiology: Co-suspected medication (methotrexate).

Follow-up information was received by UCB on 19-Dec-2014 via Astellas Pharma Inc. from a physician on 18-Dec-2014.

Information included updated medical history and laboratory test data.

Patient's medical history included: chronic gastritis.

Co-suspect drug methotrexate was administered at one time dose of 8 mg orally.

On 04-Jun-2014, laboratory investigations were performed which included: KL-6: 145 IU/ml (normal value: 0-499).

On 04-Oct-2014, laboratory investigations were performed which included: CRP: 0.3 mg/dl (normal value: 0-0.5), KL-6: 749 IU/ml and Beta D glucan: 1117pg/ml (normal value: 0-20).

UCB non-interventional study report from physician. The patient with rheumatoid arthritis, ventricular septal defect, schizophrenia and tobacco user developed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia after approximately 4 months of exposure to certolizumab pegol. Co-suspect drug included methotrexate. The patient was hospitalised and treated medically. Both suspect drugs were withdrawn and the event was resolving. The reporter considered the event pneumocystis pneumonia related to treatment with certolizumab pegol. The reporter also considered methotrexate as other etiology for the event and causality as related to methotrexate also.

On 10/21/2014, information was received from a company representative regarding a 60 year old male patient receiving intrathecal baclofen 185 mcg/mL (dose 81.38 mcg/day) and morphine 50 mg/mL (dose 21.93 mg/day) via an implanted pump. On  [RED], the reporter and patient's managing physician were informed that the patient was seen in the ER (emergency room) for respiratory depression. The physicians caring for the patient stopped the pump (programmed the pump to stopped pump mode).

The patient's medical condition was not believed to be related to the pump therapy. The patient was being transferred to an alternate hospital. As of the date of the report, the patient was receiving a Narcan drip and supplemental oxygen. The reporter noted the patient had multiple other health problems including stent placements and limb amputations. On 10/23/2014, follow up information was received from a company representative who heard the patient was ""moving from CCU to the floor so he must be doing better at this point"". The reporter had no idea the lot number of the baclofen delivered via the pump, but did note ""this was most likely Anazeo"" (compounding pharmacy). Additional inform ation has been requested, but was not available as of the date of this report.

12/09/2014 # Additional Information: Information was received from the physician#s office who provided the pump telemetry from 10/23/2014. The pump contained baclofen intrathecal (185.1 mcg/ml) and morphine (50 mg/ml), and it was programmed to deliver the minimum rate, 0.292 mg/day of morphine and 1.08 mcg/day of baclofen. An intrathecal pump record from 09/08/2014 was provided; the patient#s last pump refill had
occurred on 06/16/2014. There were no changes made to the pump dosing on 09/08/2014. The patient had moderate to unbearable pain and experienced 50% of pain relief. The pain relief was fair. As of 09/08/2014, the patient#s pump delivered baclofen intrathecal (185.1 mcg/ml; 81.38 mcg/day) and morphine intrathecal (50 mg/ml; 21.983 mg/day). The daily rate was 0.4860 ml/24 hours. The expected residual volume was 3.2 ml, and the actual residual volume was 3.4 ml. The total volume injected into the pump was 40 ml. Aspiration was completed, sterile technique was maintained, and the pump refill was well tolerated. The next pump refill date was 11/25/2014 at 10 a.m. As of 09/08/2014, the patient#s blood pressure was 118/68, heart rate was 72, and his temperature was 97.2.
Per the pump refill consultation report, the patient presented to the clinic unaccompanied for a routine drug administration system pump refill. The patient continued to reside at a convalescent center and arrived to the clinic on 09/08/2014 in a motorized wheelchair. The summary of the pump refill indicated that the patient experienced severe chronic pain of post laminectomy syndrome, complications of type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, lower limb amputations below the knees, hepatic encephalopathy, and intrathecal morphine.
Later, on  [RED], the patient was admitted to the hospital due to altered mental status, suspected unintentional narcotic overdose, and possible malfunction of the intrathecal pump. The intrathecal pump was shut off before the patient was transferred to the hospital. Per the patient, he took 2 tablets of oxycodone before he would go to physical therapy every day. The patient seemed to respond to Narcan at an outside hospital, was put on a narcan drip, and was transferred to the critical care unit. In the critical care unit, the narcan drip was stopped when the patient came to and was alert and awake. The next day, the patient remained okay and was transferred to #the floor.# The narcotic pain medication was held, and on 10/23/2014, the patient experienced mental status change again. The patient did not get any narcotic pain medication in the hospital and the intrathecal pain pump remained shut off. The patient#s ammonia level was normal and the CT scan of the patient#s head was unremarkable. At that time, neurology got involved. It was felt that the patient may have a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and narcotic overdose, even though the ammonia level was not high. It was possible that the overdose of narcotic probably needed a longer time to clear up due to hepatic disease.
The patient was given two doses of Narcan at that time. The Narcan seemed to change the patient#s status a little bit. On the same day, after a few hours the patient awoke. The pain pump was turned on to minimal rate mode in the afternoon of 10/23/2014 to avoid permanent dysfunction of the pump. Because the patient complained of generalized pain, the treatment of oxycodone q 6 hours prn resumed. The patient did not get adequate pain control. The medication was going to be increased every 4 hours prn. Oral baclofen was going to be used until the pain pump was adjusted. It was felt that the patient could be discharged
back to the nursing home. The nursing home physician was going to take care of the issues and refer the patient back to the pain clinic for
further management. The patient#s hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesaemia resolved after replacement. On 10/24/2014, the patient experienced chest pain for a couple of minutes; however, there was no shortness of breath. The Tnl was unremarkable. A stress test was performed and did not show any stress-induced ischemia. The issue was going to be further managed as an outpatient. The patient was discharged back to the nursing home on  [RED].
Pertinent lab tests and exams were provided. On 10/22/2014, the patient's vitals were as follows: weight - 9.2 kg, blood pressure - 136/55, pulse - 70, respiratory rate - 18, temperature - 98 degrees,
oxygen saturation # 100% on 2 L of oxygen. A physician examination was conducted on 10/22/2014. The patient was a 60-year-old, obese patient who was arousable to pain and responded to speech. It did not appear
that the patient was in acute respiratory distress. The patient's neck was supple without JVP (jugular venous pressure) elevation; there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The chest had good bilateral air entry and was clear of auscultation. The patient had regular heart rate and rhythm. S1, S2 was normal without murmurs. The patient had a bruise in a belt-like pattern over his left side of the abdomen; bowel sounds appeared normal. The patient#s neuro assessment indicated that he had a Glasgow Coma scale of 11 (E3, V2, M6). His pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Neurology and the pain clinic were consulted. On 10123/2014, the intrathecal pain pump was turned on again and programmed to the minimum rate. Patient labs were conducted: white blood cell # 5.2, hemoglobin # 11.4, platelet count # 52,000, 80% neutrophils, and 13% lymphs. Magnesium # 1.4, phosphate # 2.3, sodium # 134, potassium # 3.2, BUN # 13, creatinine # 0.8, glucose # 309, urine toxicology screen test was positive for opioids and oxycodone. The urine analysis was done at an outside hospital which showed that the white blood cells were 0-2, red blood cells were 3-5, glucose was more than 1000, magnesium was 1.9 on 10/23/2014, and phosphate was 2.4 on 10/24/2014. The ammonia levels were 40 and 19. Folic acid was 22.9, B12 was 821, TSH was 1.37. ABG (arterial blood gas), on 10/23/2014, the pH was 7.55, pCO2 was 30, oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. The hemoglobin Alc was 8.7, Tnl was 48, and then 46. A CT (computed tomography) of the patient's head was performed 10/21/2014. There was no acute interval changes identified when compared to the study of 02/25/2014. There did not appear to be mild diffuse atrophy through not striking for age. A CT of the patient's head was performed on 10/23/2014, and the exam was moderately degraded by motion. There were no acute intracranial processes identified, and there were stable mild age-related changes. A chest x-ray was performed on 10/21/2014 which indicated that the bronchovascular prominence bilaterally of uncertain significance was mostly technical related to rotation, low inspiratory lung volumes and body habitus. Bronchopneumonia could not be excluded, aspiration change, or other infection or inflammatory process. An EKG was performed on 10/24/2014 which showed a normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG, rate 61, a non-specific T-way abnormality no longer evident in anterior leads. The EEG per verbal report, there was no seizure activity.
The final patient diagnosis was acute mental status change, likely due to the combination of hepatic encephalopathy and possible unintentional narcotic overdose, and concern about the malfunction of the intrathecal pump. The patient experienced chest pain, and had a normal stress test. The patient was also diagnosed with hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphatemia. Other diagnoses included diabetes mellitus (on insulin), cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy (on chronic PO Lactulose), chronic back pain, status post 8 surgeries to his back, depression, portal hypertension, hypertension, celiac disease, bilateral below-the-knee amputations, thrombocytopenia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and dyslipidemia.

Follow-Up Received on 18-Dec-2014
SE/Manufacturer for case number 10559860
Version 2

On 10/21/2014, information was received from a company representative regarding a 60 year old male patient receiving intrathecal baclofen 185 mcg/mL (dose 81.38 mcg/day) and morphine 50 mg/mL (dose 21.93 mg/day) via an implanted pump. On 10/21/2014, the reporter and patient's managing physician were informed that the patient was seen in the ER (emergency room) for respiratory depression. The physicians caring for
the patient stopped the pump (programmed the pump to stopped pump mode). The patient's medical condition was not believed to be related to the pump therapy. The patient was being transferred to an alternate hospital. As of the date of the report, the patient was receiving a Narcan drip and supplemental oxygen. The reporter noted the patient had multiple other health problems including stent placements and limb amputations. On 10/23/2014, follow up information was received from a company representative who heard the patient was ""moving from CCU to the floor so he must be doing better at this point"". The reporter had no idea the lot number of the baclofen delivered via the pump, but did note ""this was most likely Anazeo"" (compounding pharmacy). Additional inform ation has been requested, but was not available as of the date of this report.

12/09/2014 - Additional Information: Information was received from the physician's office who provided the pump telemetry from 10/23/2014. The pump contained baclofen intrathecal (185.1 mcg/ml) and morphine (50 mg/ml), and it was programmed to deliver the minimum rate, 0.292 mg/day of morphine and 1.08 mcg/day of baclofen. An intrathecal pump record from 09/08/2014 was provided; the patient's last pump refill had
occurred on 06/16/2014. There were no changes made to the pump dosing on 09/08/2014. The patient had moderate to unbearable pain and experienced 50% of pain relief. The pain relief was fair. As of 09/08/2014, the patient's pump delivered baclofen intrathecal (185.1 mcg/ml; 81.38 mcg/day) and morphine intrathecal (50 mg/ml; 21.983 mg/day). The daily rate was 0.4860 ml/24 hours. The expected residual volume was 3.2 ml, and the actual residual volume was 3.4 ml. The total volume injected into the pump was 40 ml. Aspiration was completed, sterile technique was maintained, and the pump refill was well tolerated. The next pump refill date was 11/25/2014 at 10 a.m. As of 09/08/2014, the patient's blood pressure was 118/68, heart rate was 72, and his temperature was 97.2.
Per the pump refill consultation report, the patient presented to the clinic unaccompanied for a routine drug administration system pump refill. The patient continued to reside at a convalescent center and arrived to the clinic on 09/08/2014 in a motorized wheelchair. The summary of the pump refill indicated that the patient experienced severe chronic pain of post laminectomy syndrome, complications of type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, lower limb amputations below the knees, hepatic encephalopathy, and intrathecal morphine. Later, on [RED], the patient was admitted to the hospital due to altered mental status, suspected unintentional narcotic overdose, and possible malfunction of the intrathecal pump. The intrathecal pump was shut off before the patient was transferred to the hospital. Per the patient, he took 2 tablets of oxycodone before he would go to physical therapy every day. The patient seemed to respond to Narcan at an outside hospital, was put on a narcan drip, and was transferred to the critical care unit. In the critical care unit, the narcan drip was
stopped when the patient came to and was alert and awake. The next day, the patient remained okay and was transferred to ""the floor."" The narcotic pain medication was held, and on [RED], the patient experienced mental status change again. The patient did not get any narcotic pain medication in the hospital and the intrathecal pain pump remained shut off. The patient's ammonia level was normal and the CT scan of the patient's head was unremarkable. At that time, neurology got involved. It was felt that the patient may have a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and narcotic overdose, even though the ammonia level was not high. It was possible that the overdose of narcotic probably needed a longer I time to clear up due to hepatic disease.
The patient was given two doses of Narcan at that time. The Narcan seemed to change the patient's status a little bit. On the same day, after a few hours the patient awoke. The pain pump was turned on to minimal rate mode in the afternoon of [RED] to avoid permanent dysfunction of the pump. Because the patient complained of generalized pain, the treatment of oxycodone q 6 hours pm resumed. The patient did not get adequate pain control. The medication was going to be increased every 4 hours prn. Oral baclofen was going to be used until the pain pump was adjusted. It was felt that the patient could be discharged back to the nursing home. The nursing home physician was going to take care of the issues and refer the patient back to the pain clinic for further management. The patient's hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesaemia resolved after replacement. On [RED], the patient experienced chest pain for a couple of minutes; however, there was no shortness of breath. The Tnl was unremarkable. A stress test was performed and did not show any stress-induced ischemia. The issue was going to be further managed as an outpatient. The patient was discharged back to the nursing home on [RED].
Pertinent lab tests and exams were provided. On 10/22/2014, the patient's vitals were as follows: weight - 9.2 kg, blood pressure - 136/55, pulse - 70, respiratory rate - 18, temperature - 98 degrees,
oxygen saturation -100% on 2 L of oxygen. A physician examination was conducted on 10/22/2014. The patient was a 60-year-old, obese patient who was arousable to pain and responded to speech. It did not appear that the patient was in acute respiratory distress. The patient's neck was supple without JVP (jugular venous pressure) elevation; there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The chest had good bilateral air entry and was clear of auscultation. The patient had regular heart rate and rhythm. S1, S2 was normal without murmurs. The patient had a bruise in a belt-like pattern over his left side of the abdomen; bowel sounds appeared normal. The patient's neuro assessment indicated that he had a Glasgow Coma scale of 11 (E3, V2, M6). His pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Neurology and the pain clinic were consulted. On 10/23/2014, the intrathecal pain pump was turned on again and programmed to the minimum rate. Patient labs were conducted: white blood cell – 5.2, hemoglobin -11.4, platelet count – 52,000, 80% neutrophils, and 13% lymphs. Magnesium -1.4, phosphate – 2.3, sodium – 134, potassium–3.2, BUN–13, creatinine–0.8, glucose–309, urine toxicology screen test was positive for opioids and oxycodone. The urine analysis was done at an outside hospital which showed that the white blood cells were 0-2, red blood cells were 3-5, glucose was more than 1000, magnesium was 1.9 on 10/23/2014, and phosphate was 2.4 on 10/24/2014. The ammonia levels were 40 and 19. Folic acid was 22.9, B12 was 821, TSH was 1.37. ABG (arterial blood gas), on 10/23/2014, the pH was 7.55, pCO2 was 30, oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. The hemoglobin Alc was 8.7, Tnl was 48, and then 46. A CT (computed tomography) of the patient's head was performed 10/21/2014. There was no acute interval changes identified when compared to the study of 02/25/2014. There did not appear to be mild diffuse atrophy through not striking for age. A CT of the patient's head was performed on 10/23/2014, and the exam was moderately degraded by motion. There were no acute intracranial processes identified, and there were stable mild age-related changes. A chest x-ray was performed on 10/21/2014 which indicated that the bronchovascular prominence bilaterally of uncertain significance was mostly technical related to rotation, low inspiratory lung volumes and body habitus. Bronchopneumonia could not be excluded, aspiration change, or other infection or inflammatory process. An EKG was performed on 10/24/2014 which showed a normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG, rate 61, a non-specific T-way abnormality no longer evident in anterior leads. The EEG per verbal report, there was no seizure activity.
The final patient diagnosis was acute mental status change, likely due to the combination of hepatic encephalopathy and possible unintentional narcotic overdose, and concern about the malfunction of the intrathecal pump. The patient experienced chest pain, and had a normal stress test. The patient was also diagnosed with hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphatemia. Other diagnoses included diabetes mellitus (on insulin), cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy (on chronic PO Lactulose), chronic back pain, status post 8 surgeries to his back, depression, portal hypertension, hypertension, celiac disease, bilateral below-the-knee amputations, thrombocytopenia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and dyslipidemia.
Upon discharge, the patient was newly prescribed oral baclofen 10 mg Tablets ('%tablet (5 mg) by mouth three times daily.

Right lower quadrant pain [Abdominal pain lower]
Stool mixed with blood [Haematochezia]
Bowel movement consisting of only pure blood [Rectal haemorrhage] Constipation
 [Constipation] ([Faeces hard])
Distention worsened [Abdominal distension]

Case Description:
A healthcare professional reported the occurrence of abdominal pain, constipation (with stool began to be pellet like), stool was mixed with blood, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, distention worsened, and bowel movements consisting of only pure blood in a 34 year-old male patient who was prescribed Zenpep (pancrelipase) capsules for PERT (pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy), pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was enrolled in the CF-FC study on 24-Oct-2014, after the onset of the adverse event.

The patient's relevant past medical history included obstructive lung disease, chronic sinus disease, frequent bowel obstructions and DIOS (distal ileal obstruction syndrome) on 15-May-2008 and 18-Sep-2012. Past procedures included; the patient had required multiple decompressive colonoscopies and the symptoms rarely resolved with barium enemas. Concurrent medical conditions included cystic fibrosis. Historical drugs, co-suspect medications and concomitant medications were not included.

On an unspecified date, the patient started Zenpep (pancrelipase) capsules; dosage, route and frequency were not provided. On  [RED], the patient was admitted to hospital for abdominal pain and constipation. The patient had started Miralax (macrogol) immediately after constipation began. He continued to have bowel movements, last one overnight. The patient was discharged on  [RED]. On an unspecified date, he developed acutely worsening abdominal pain which became severe. On 24-Oct-2014, the patient signed the informed consent for the CF-FC study. He was admitted to the hospital for right lower quadrant pain, constipation, stool began to be pellet like, and stool was mixed with blood. He then developed bowel movement consisting of only pure blood. Miralax was started but constipation and distention worsened. Consultation with GI recommended aggressive enemas of all forms (tap water, fleets, soap suds) combined with manual disimpaction, followed by more enemas. Once things started to move, he was to proceed with Gastrografin (meglumine amidotrizoate, sodium amidotrizoate) enema. Radiographic findings on admission: abundant formed stool throughout the colon from rectum to cecum. The descending colon was mildly dilated. Further treatment measures were not specified. Additional test results were not provided. The patient had not recovered as of 27-Oct-2014. The action taken with Zenpep was unknown.

Outcome: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, abdominal pain and constipation: Not Recovered
Bowel movement consisting of only pure blood, Stool mixed with blood and Distention worsened: Not Reported

Reporter's comments/causality assessment: The reporting healthcare professional considered that the events of abdominal pain and constipation were possibly related to treatment with Zenpep. The reporter did not provide causality for the event of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, bowel movement consisting of only pure blood, stool mixed with blood and distention worsened in relation to therapy with Zenpep.

Follow-up information was received from a healthcare professional on 20-Nov-2014.

Additional test results included an abdominal x-ray, AP 2 views, on 18-Oct-2014, which showed the descending colon is mildly dilated. A barium enema, on 18-Oct-2014, showed colon was mildly dilated and filled with stool.

The action taken with Zenpep was none.

Follow-up information was received on 11-Dec-2014 from the investigator.

The discharge date of the first hospitalization was changed from  [RED] to  [RED] No further information was provided. 

Follow-up information was received from a healthcare professional on 30-Dec-2014.

Concomitant medications included Ventolin (salbutamol), Accuneb (salbutamol sulfate), tobramycin, aztreonam, azithromycin, PEG 3350 (macrogol), dornase alfa, Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide), BSN Syntha-6 protein shake, Vitamin D3 ( colecalciferol), ciprofloxacin, lactobacillus rhamnosus, Tylenol (paracetamol), Fortaz (ceftazidime), Tygacil (tigecycline), Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride), Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium), Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium), Coumadin (warfarin sodium), Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride), Fluzone (influenza vaccine), pantoprazole, Mephyton (phytomenadione), Bactrium (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), Zofran (ondansetron), heparin, Protonix (pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate), Versed (midazolam hydrochloride), fentanyl, Levaquin (levofloxacin), Zyvox (linezolid) and ibuprofen.

The patient started Zenpep (pancrelipase) 20,000 U capsules on 10-Sep-2013, at a dosage of 6 capsules (120,000U) with meals and 4 capsules (80,000U) with snacks. Weight at start of Zenpep was 63.5 kg. On  [RED], the patient was hospitalized for right lower quadrant pain, constipation, stool began to be pellet like, stool mixed with blood, then bowel movement consisting of only pure blood. The patient was started on Miralax and constipation and distention worsened. Additional test, acute abdomen series was reported, done on 17-Oct-2014 and showed large amount of stool consistent with constipation with multiple mildly dilated small bowel loops. On 17-Oct-2014, the patient received Enemeez (phosphoric acid sodium) 1 bottle, rectal for treatment of DIOS (distal ileal obstruction syndrome). He also received Dilaudid 1 mg intravenous for pain on 17-Oct-2014 to 18-Oct-2014. The patient was discharged on  [RED]. He received Colace (docusate sodium) 100 mg frequency unknown beginning on 19-Oct-2014 and continues Colace for DIOS. Prednisone oral 10 mg, frequency unknown was given from 19-Oct-2014 to 24-Oct-2014, for unspecified indication. Zenpep continued at the same dosage.

Outcome: Not reported

Follow-up information was received on 11-Feb-2015 from the investigator. Additional information was provided regarding the hospitalization on  [RED].

During the admission, the patient's bowel regime was optimized and he received enemas every 2 hours in an effort to increase bowel movements. Constipation was successfully addressed within 48-hour admission. He was able to tolerate oral diet and subsequently discharged on  [RED], with oral bowel regimes consisting of MiraLax (macrogol), Colace (docusate sodium) and senna. At the Pulmonary clinic follow-up visit, on 24-Oct-2014, the patient felt back to normal, from a GI standpoint. He had been taking MiraLax daily, as well as Colace. He was prescribed senna, but had not been able to get that yet. The patient did not have any further bloody stool. He was advised to continue MiraLax daily to prevent recurrent episodes. He was referred to have a colonoscopy to evaluate for evidence of fibrosing colonopathy, strictures, or evidence of colon cancer.

Outcome: Recovered

Case Comment:
This 34-year-old male patient experienced Abdominal pain lower, Haematochezia, Rectal haemorrhage, Constipation (associated with Faeces hard), and Abdominal distension while being treated with Zenpep (pancrelipase) for Pancreatic insufficiency. The underlying conditions and medical history, including cystic fibrosis with pulmonary exacerbations, obstructive lung disease,
chronic sinus disease, distal ileal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), frequent bowel obstructions, as well as the multiple past and recent therapeutic procedures, including multiple decompressive colonoscopies and barium enemas, performed in this patient on multiple concomitant medications, including ibuprofen and citalopram, are more likely explanations of the Haematochezia and Rectal haemorrhage. There is no reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between Zenpep and these two adverse events. Considering the plausible temporal sequence, the current knowledge on the product in question, and despite the existence of other alternative explanations (i.e. the above-mentioned medical history, with previous episodes of abdominal pain and constipation; concomitant medications), there is a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between Zenpep and Abdominal pain lower, Constipation, and Abdominal distension.
Despite the suggestive temporal sequence, there is no reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between AquADEKs and the reported adverse events, which can more plausibly be explained by the underlying conditions and concomitant administration of
multiple medications, including Zenpep, in this patient.

In Nov 2013, the patient underwent an ultrasound of thyroid that showed a nodule that seemed being benign. As corrective treatment, the patient would undergo a punction on unspecified date and in the future, on unspecified date, she would undergo a surgery (unspecified). As of 04 Nov 2014, as corrective therapy for nodule in the thyroid, on  [RED] the patient underwent a surgery, in which the entire right lobe of the thyroid was removed and a little piece of the left lobe was left to see if it was able to produce a little amount of hormone. The patient's physician prescribed the medication Puran T4 (levothyroxine sodium ) 50 mcg once daily because he did not know if the patient would produce hormone or not. According to the patient, she remained only one day, on [RED] without injecting Rebif and when she resumed the treatment she experienced reactions of headache, chills, tremors and fever, as if she was starting the treatment again. No corrective treatment was done for the events, it improved alone, but on the day after it looked like the patient had been run over by a tractor. The physician was aware about the events.

He was a participant in ROF-MD-07, A 52-week, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Effect of Roflumilast 500 μg on Exacerbation Rate in Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Treated with a Fixed Dose Combination of Long-Acting Beta Agonist and Inhaled Corticosteroid (LABA/ICS).

Relevant medical history included chronic paranoid schizophrenia since 09-Sep-2008 (controlled off medications since 2012), chronic lower back pain since 2011, spondylosis since 14-Aug-2014, and COPD and tobacco use disorder, both since unspecified dates. The patient was also noted to be a veteran and non-service connected. He reported ambulating without an assistive device and being independent with his activities of daily living (ADLs). According to his VA records which went back to 2011, he had not been treated for schizophrenia nor had a re-lapse.

Concomitant medications included tiotropium since 17-Jan-2014 and methocarbamol from 15-Sep-2014 to 25-Oct-2014.

Double-blind study medication was started on 08-Sep-2014. On 24-Oct-2014, 46 days after starting the study drug the patient was seen by his primary care provider but was late to his appointment and was observed to have loud and tangential behavior as well as being disorganized and rambling incoherently. His girlfriend was called, and she said she had noticed him acting bizarrely. He was referred to the emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation. Portable chest single view revealed spondylosis (considered medical history). On  [RED], the study drug was temporarily discontinued, and he was admitted to the hospital. He was seen by the psychiatrist and placed on a 72 hour hold due to grave disability. There were no signs of suicide or anger that would result in assault to others. He reported that he had problems since his good friend left town. Head CT revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage nor mass effect; Mild presumed chronic small vessel ischemic changes; Low-lying cerebellar tonsils, suboptimally evaluated by CT, possible reflecting Chiari I malformation; age-indeterminate bilateral nasal bone fracture deformity; Posterior nasopharyngeal soft tissues are prominent for age, effacing the fossa of Rosenmuller; Partially visualized poor dentition with multiple missing teeth and dental caries. He was diagnosed with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia disorder. He was treated with olanzapine 10 mg daily from 25-Oct-2014 and continuing. Laboratory findings were within normal limits (WNL) or not clinically significant (NCS). On  [RED], the patient recovered. He was alert and oriented x3, pleasant and cooperative. He denied any feeling of sadness, hopelessness, hallucinations, and did not endorse any suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. He was discharged and recommended to take olanzapine 5 mg as needed for agitation. At the time of this report the study drug was still discontinued but the patient continued in the study.

Recurrent cholangitis [Cholangitis]
Recurrent common bile duct stones [Condition aggravated]

Case Description:
This report was derived from the medical literature and describes the occurrence of recurrent cholangitis and recurrent common bile duct stones in a 57 year-old male patient who received Ursodeoxycholic acid, formulation unspecified for stones in the intrahepatic bile duct.

See companion cases AXC-2014-000710, AXC-2014-000712 and AXC-2014-000713 which were derived from the same literature article.

Relevant past medical history included cholelithiasis, cholangitis, bile duct stricture, and diabetes mellitus. Concurrent medical conditions were not included. Past procedures included an open cholecystectomy at age 51, and hepaticoduodenostomy at age 52, with anastomosis between the left hepatic duct and duodenum. Historical drugs, and co-suspected medications were not included. Concomitant medication included famotidine.

At age 51, the patient complained of postprandial right upper quadrant pain and underwent open cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. Cholangitis secondary to post-surgical bile duct stricture developed; hence hepaticoduodenostomy was performed at 52 years of age. However, cholangitis resulting from the presence of stones in the intrahepatic bile duct persisted. Ursodeoxycholic acid, formulation unspecified was started on an unspecified date at 600 mg a day when the patient was 57 years old. However, cholangitis recurred every eight months on average until 61 years of age. ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) was performed, and stones consisting of Ursodeoxycholic acid and fatty acid calcium were detected. Endoscopic findings showed food debris in the bile duct. Ursodeoxycholic acid was discontinued, with no further recurrence of cholangitis.

Outcome: Recovered

Author's comments/causality assessment: The authors considered that the events were related to treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid. The authors hypothesized the Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) particularly unconjugated UDCA was easily regurgitated from the duodenum into the bile duct due to the extended orfice of the bile duct in this case. In addition, bile with pH of 8.0 -8.6 may precipitate unconjugated UDCA, which would complicate UDCA drainage which may promote the formation of stone cores. The authors stated the occurrence of anastomosis between the bile duct and duodenum and/or recurrent biliary infection is associated with UDCA stone formation.

F-up information was received from our license partner Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (Ref. # MTPC2014-0013264 on 08-Dec-2014.

Relevant past medical history of diabetes was changed to concurrent medical condition. It was reported that the patient was hospitalized for recurrent common bile duct stones.

Case Comment:
This 57 year-old male patient experienced Cholangitis and Condition aggravated while being treated with ursodeoxycholic acid for Bile duct stone.
A positive dechallenge was reported in this case. Of note, before the start of ursodeoxycholic acid therapy, this patient had conditions that favored the generation of bile duct stones, such as recurrent intra-hepatic bile duct stones and biliary infection and reflux of intestinal contents into the bile duct. In this case, cholangitis was a consequence of bile duct stones.
Considering the plausible temporal sequence, as well as the biological plausibility and the positive dechallenge, and despite the existence of other alternative explanations, there is a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between ursodeoxycholic acid and Condition aggravation.
Considering the existence of a more plausible alternative explanation, there is no reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between ursodeoxycholic acid and the event Cholangitis.

Recurrent cholangitis [Cholangitis]
Recurrent common bile duct stones [Condition aggravated]

Case Description:
This report was derived from the medical literature and describes the occurrence of recurrent cholangitis and recurrent common bile duct stones in a 57 year-old male patient who received Ursodeoxycholic acid, formulation unspecified for stones in the intrahepatic bile duct.

See companion cases AXC-2014-000710, AXC-2014-000712 and AXC-2014-000713 which were derived from the same literature article.

Relevant past medical history included cholelithiasis, cholangitis, bile duct stricture, and diabetes mellitus. Concurrent medical conditions were not included. Past procedures included an open cholecystectomy at age 51, and hepaticoduodenostomy at age 52, with anastomosis between the left hepatic duct and duodenum. Historical drugs, and co-suspected medications were not included. Concomitant medication included famotidine.

At age 51, the patient complained of postprandial right upper quadrant pain and underwent open cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. Cholangitis secondary to post-surgical bile duct stricture developed; hence hepaticoduodenostomy was performed at 52 years of age. However, cholangitis resulting from the presence of stones in the intrahepatic bile duct persisted. Ursodeoxycholic acid, formulation unspecified was started on an unspecified date at 600 mg a day when the patient was 57 years old. However, cholangitis recurred every eight months on average until 61 years of age. ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) was performed, and stones consisting of Ursodeoxycholic acid and fatty acid calcium were detected. Endoscopic findings showed food debris in the bile duct. Ursodeoxycholic acid was discontinued, with no further recurrence of cholangitis.

Outcome: Recovered

Author's comments/causality assessment: The authors considered that the events were related to treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid. The authors hypothesized the Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) particularly unconjugated UDCA was easily regurgitated from the duodenum into the bile duct due to the extended orfice of the bile duct in this case. In addition, bile with pH of 8.0 -8.6 may precipitate unconjugated UDCA, which would complicate UDCA drainage which may promote the formation of stone cores. The authors stated the occurrence of anastomosis between the bile duct and duodenum and/or recurrent biliary infection is associated with UDCA stone formation.

Additional details: Consumer noted increase in blood sugar started last night (05 October 2014) and blood sugar was high this morning. She stated her blood sugars are getting better but they are still much too high. Consumer has started using more insulin to treat increase in blood sugars.

Follow-up information was received on 21 October 2014 from the patient via a call center representative. The event of blood glucose increased was reported (previously reported).  The patient reported that Breo had pushed her blood glucose number through the ceiling and specifically mentioned that the value got up to 570.

Social Media report from USA by a female consumer with events of non-serious decreased energy, ic, didn't work, increased thirst, increased hunger, bloated all the time, foggy thinking and brain not as sharp and not as quick to recall with levothyroxine (SYNTHROID). There was no reported medical history. On unknown dates, the patient experienced decreased energy, ic, didn't work, increased thirst, increased hunger, bloated all the time, foggy thinking and brain not as sharp and not as quick to recall. The patient reported taking thyroid medication for 30 years. Levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) did not work for her so she was on levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID) which was no longer available according to her doctor, so she was switched to levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) and then that was not available. She then took levothyroxine. The patient reported has been off of her thyroid medications for almost a month and her ""IC"" has improved. She does not suffer from foggy thinking as much and had a lot more energy. Her brain was sharper and she was quicker to recall. She did not have such a strong thirst or hunger as before and she still maintained her required fluid intake, but used the restroom less and did not feel so bloated all the time. The patient stated that it appeared there was some connection with thyroid medications and IC. Which really surprised her. Levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) and levothyroxine were also considered suspect.

Causality for Levothyroxine (SYNTHROID): causality for the events of decreased energy, didn't work, increased thirst, increased hunger, bloated all the time, foggy thinking and brain not as sharp and not as quick to recall was not provided. The reporter stated that there is a reasonable possibility that the event of IC is related to Levothyroxine (SYNTHROID).",,THINKING ABNORMAL:ABDOMINAL DISTENSION:HUNGER:MEMORY IMPAIRMENT:ASTHENIA:THIRST:DRUG INEFFECTIVE,ABDOMINAL DISTENSION:ASTHENIA:DRUG INEFFECTIVE:HUNGER:MEMORY IMPAIRMENT:THINKING ABNORMAL:THIRST,"THINKING DISTURBANCES:THERAPEUTIC AND NONTHERAPEUTIC RESPONSES:FEELINGS AND SENSATIONS NEC:ASTHENIC CONDITIONS:FLATULENCE, BLOATING AND DISTENSION:MEMORY LOSS (EXCL DEMENTIA)",MENTAL IMPAIRMENT DISORDERS:GENERAL SYSTEM DISORDERS NEC:THERAPEUTIC AND NONTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS (EXCL TOXICITY):DISTURBANCES IN THINKING AND PERCEPTION:GASTROINTESTINAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS,PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS:NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS:GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS:GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS,,ASTHENIA,,THIRST,,HUNGER,,ABDOMINAL DISTENSION,,THINKING ABNORMAL,,MEMORY IMPAIRMENT,DRUG INEFFECTIVE,,,,,,N,,LEVOTHROID:LEVOTHYROXINE:LEVOXYL(PS):SYNTHROID,LEVOTHYROXINE:LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM:LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM:LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM(PS),LEVOTHYROXINE:LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM(PS),Levoxyl:LEVOTHROID:SYNTHROID:LEVOTHYROXINE,,LEVOXYL,LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM,Levoxyl,,,PS,,,,,,UNK,TABLET,,,,,,,, ,,PFIZER,NDA,021301,,,LEVOTHYROXINE,LEVOTHYROXINE,LEVOTHYROXINE,,,SS,,,,,,UNK,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,SYNTHROID,LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM,SYNTHROID,,,SS,,,,,,UNK,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,LEVOTHROID,LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM,LEVOTHROID,,,SS,,,,,,UNK,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient with severe coronary artery disease and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, especially non-insulin dependent diabetes treated with metformin, sitagliptin phosphate (JANUVIA) and amarel.
Since 08-NOV-2014 there was deterioration in health status with vomiting and diarrhea and then on 09-NOV-2014 very intense abdominal pain.
Patient was hospitalized on [RED].
On admission, biological workup showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH=6.72) with hyperkalemia (5.6 mmol/L), severe renal failure (serum creatinine= 637 micromol/L, creatinine clearance= 15 ml/min) and hyperlactatemia (24 mmol/L).
Plasma metformin determination was at 45.77 microg/ml and red blood cell metformin determination at 11.77 microg/ml.
These very high results were in favor of a recent accumulation.
Evolution was marked by worsening of the hemodynamic status in a context of multiple organ failure.

This case was firstly reported by a French health professional to Guerbet Pharmacovigilance Department HQ on 28 November 2014 and later on the same date, by a French physician from the HYPSIC PMS (centre 387). All information was merged together.

An 81-year-old male patient, with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, pleura injury secondary to cancer, no known allergy nor previous immediate hypersensitivity, was administered 20 mL of Dotarem (gadoteric acid), batch number 14GS735A, by IV route, for MRI, for unspecified cancer, on 27 November 2014. There was no information on concomitant medication provided.

On[RED], five minutes after Dotarem administration, the patient experienced an anaphylactic shock corresponding to a grade IV hypersensitivity reaction (according to the Ring and Messmer classification) described as feeling of cranial warmness with a short convulsion, then cardiac arrest. As corrective care, cardiac massage was underwent and the patient was admitted to emergency for other convulsion, sweating and tongue beating then comatous state. The Emergency Unit confirmed the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock with renal insufficiency linked to the shock. The final outcome was not recovered.

The reporter evaluated the case as serious (life-threatening and hospitalisation) with a severe intensity and assessed the causal relationship between Dotarem and the adverse reactions as highly probable.

According to the Dotarem CCSI used as reference safety information, anaphylactic shock with cardiac arrest, coma, convulsion are listed and prerenal failure linked to shock is unlisted.
Based on the available information, the case was evaluated as serious (hospitalisation and life-threatening) and according to the official French Method of Imputability, the Company assessed the causal relationship between Dotarem and the adverse drug reactions as possible (C2 S2 I2).
Severe anaphylactic shock can lead to cardiac arrest. Resulting low cardiac output can aggravate initial clinical picture as reported in the case and convulsion, coma and prerenal failure can be the consequences. Pre-existing conditions such as cancer and age may also play a role notably in delaying the improvement.

Further information has been requested.

Follow-up information obtained from a French health professional by Guerbet Pharmacovigilance Department on 17 December 2014.

The patient was discharged from resuscitation unit and recovered from anaphylactic shock.

The Company assessment remains unchanged.

This case was firstly reported by a French health professional to Guerbet Pharmacovigilance Depoartment HQ on 28 November 2014 and later on the same date, by a French physician from the HYPSIC PMS (center 387). All information was merged together.

An 81-year-old male , patient, with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, pleura injury secondary to cancer, no known allergy nor previous immediate hypersensitivity, was administered 20 ml, of Dotarem (gadoteric acid), batch number 14GS735A, by IV route, for MRI, for unspecified cancer, on 27 November 2014. There was no information on concomitant medication provided.

On 27 November 2014, five minutes after Dotarem administration, the patient enperienoed an anaphylactic shock corresponding to a grade IV hypersensitivity reaction (aosording to the Ring and Messmer classification) described as feeling of cranial warmness with a short convulsion, then cardiac arrest. As corrective care, cardiac massage was underwent and the patient was admitted to emergency for other convulsion, sweating and tongue  beating then comatous state. The Emergency Unit oonfirmed the diagnosis of anaphylaotic shock with renal insufficiency linked to the shock. The final outcome was not recovered.

The reporter evaluated the case as (life-threatening and hospitalisation) with a severe intensity and
assessed the causal relationship between Dotarem and the adverse reactions as highly probable.

According to the Dotarem CCSI used as reference safety information, anaphylactic shock with cardiac arrest, coma, oonvulsion are listed and prerenal failure linked to shock is unlisted.
Based on the available information, the case was evaluated as serious (hospitalisation and life-threatening) and according to the official French Method of Imputability, the Company assessed the causal relationship between Dotarem and the adverse drug reactions as possible C2 S2 I2).
Severe anaphylactic shock can lead to cardiac arrest. Resulting low cardiac output can aggravate initial clinical picture as reported in the case and convulsion, and and prerenal failure can be the consequences.

This poorly documented report from a Consumer concerns a 56-Years-old Female patient who received METFORMIN (Product cannot be excluded as a Teva product) and THYRAX DUOTAB TABLET 0,025MG (LEVOTHYROXINE NATRIUM-X-WATER, not Teva's product). 

Narrative translation:
Adverse event(s) treated? Yes, namely with: adverse event 1; in June 2012 received injection with corticozoden (?? cortisone is meant?) After that physiotherapy and fitness, sometimes mild pain.
Adverse event 2, went to the pain policlinic for this Lyrica (pregabaline) did not help but caused more adverse events. Qutenza (capsaicin)  patches also worked for a short while and after that the pain came back. Went to a neurologist who excluded neuropathic pain
Adverse event 3: The urologist cannot give an explanation for this
Adverse event 10: In the mean time I am 130 kg, the most weight gain is caused by medication
Metformin (2005 until now) among others, amiodaron (2009-2010) Thyrax (levothyroxine)
Whatever I am trying, l am not able to lose weight
Adverse event 13: I received Artelac (hypromellose) from the ophthalmologist for this
Adverse event 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 not treated
Did you use the medication which caused the adverse event(s) before? No
Are there possibly any other causes or circumstances which may have caused or aggravated the adverse event(s)? Yes, namely: stress. I noticed that in stressful situations the complaints are becoming worse. Unfortunately the stress also influences the thyroid and I also notice a relation with the medication
Extra information: I used two points, the first is September 2012 when I started to use Thyrax. The second is March 2014 when I started to use the blisters instead of the bottle. I have indicated the complaints which are due to the blisters according to me
Possible interaction with other medication? Yes
Does the patient use any other medication? Yes
Other comments: I cannot fill in the start date of alfacalcidol since this is after the start date of Thyrax

In 2012 I discovered my Levoxyl was the culprit causing me a severe lower legs their strange frightening mid day weakness and mobility impairment and outdoor fall risk factor. Preferred it to Synthroid because it had no sulfites as Synthroid mfg stated it has. So to prevent that added mid day walking problem during my already extended total joint replacement rehab period I began taking the levoxyl before bed so it would cause its 6-9 post pill leg side effects while I was asleep. Then in 2013 I began to try other thyroid pills like ones with no inactive ingredients to see if they could be morning dosed without leg problems. They could but cost was prohibitive after Levoxyl was pulled off the market for about a year for some so called bad canister repair. Then in July 2014 when Levoxyl was back on market I decided to try it in the morning again and since it no longer had that side effect on me I kept on it as a morning dose In Oct. 2014 left hip/thigh pain began and in mid Nov 2014 I was diagnosed with a severe thinning left femur (fracture/fracture risk) and left femur bone tumor and it was operated on and removed on [RED] I came home from hospital on[RED] and being suspicoius of Levoxyl for some time past, I immediately changed from Levoxyl to a Walgren generic version of levothyroxine the next day.

Reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after iatrogenic epinephrine injection requiring percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Can-J-Anesth 2014; 61(12) 1093-1097 

A 49-year-old woman developed reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and refractory cardiogenic shock after inadvertent administration of epinephrine [ indication not stated ]. She received an epinephrine injection at 1mg inadvertently [ route not stated ] following a surgery. She presented with reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and developed refractory cardiogenic shock [ time to reactions onset not stated ]. She received emergency percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. After 4 days, she was weaned from the support and subsequently discharged without further complications. Investigations confirmed the iatrogenic nature of her reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Follow-up information received 19-Dec-2014:

The following additional information was provided in the translation of the original article (received on 19 Dec 2014): The woman was hospitalised for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After induction of anaesthesia, she suffered acute sinus bradycardia, which continued though she received atropine. She then received an IV epinephrine injection at 1mg. Immediately after the injection, she presented with a bout of hypertension followed by a transition to ventricular tachycardia that spontaneously resolved in a few seconds. At the end of the hypertensive episode, major circulatory depression occurred with a mean blood pressure lower than 40 mmHg, associated with a sinus tachycardia of 100 bpm. An emergency trans-oesophageal echocardiography showed left ventricular dysfunction with basal akinesia and prolonged apical contractility. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be 10-15%. She received dobutamine and epinephrine. Subsequently, her haemodynamic state was satisfactorily restored and she underwent the surgery. After surgery, she was transferred to the ICU under sedation and ventilation. She was diagnosed with reverse Takotsubo. In view of the refractory cardiogenic shock and poorly tolerated acute pulmonary oedema, the woman received emergency percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, her cardiac pathology continued to aggravate and she presented with cardio-circulatory arrest under ventricular fibrillation. Her sinus rhythm was restored while performing ECMO. The period of low cardiac output lasted for 5 minutes and haemodynamic stability was obtained. He was then transferred to the ICU where therapeutic hypothermia was induced at 34 degC for 24 hours in view of the cardiac arrest. She also developed lactic metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure with conserved diuresis, liver failure due to hepatic cytolysis. She progressed rapidly with the medical assistance provided. Daily echographic tests showed a gradual recovery of her left ventricular systolic function and of the contractility of the lateral and septal walls. After 4 days, she was weaned from the support. After 9 days, she was extubated and left the ICU after 12 days without further complications. Investigations confirmed the iatrogenic nature of her reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was discharged after 1 month of recuperation and her left ventricular function recovered.",,METABOLIC ACIDOSIS;HEPATIC CYTOLYSIS;DRUG ADMINISTRATION ERROR;VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION;TAKO-TSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY;CARDIAC ARREST;CARDIOGENIC SHOCK;ACUTE RENAL FAILURE;LIVER FAILURE,HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY;CARDIAC ARREST;CARDIOGENIC SHOCK;VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION;HEPATIC FAILURE;METABOLIC ACIDOSIS;ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY;STRESS CARDIOMYOPATHY;DRUG ADMINISTRATION ERROR,RENAL FAILURE AND IMPAIRMENT;MALADMINISTRATIONS;METABOLIC ACIDOSES (EXCL DIABETIC ACIDOSES);CARDIOMYOPATHIES;HEPATOCELLULAR DAMAGE AND HEPATITIS NEC;HEART FAILURES NEC;HEPATIC FAILURE AND ASSOCIATED DISORDERS;VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS AND CARDIAC ARREST,HEART FAILURES;HEPATIC AND HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS;MYOCARDIAL DISORDERS;MEDICATION ERRORS;RENAL DISORDERS (EXCL NEPHROPATHIES);ACID-BASE DISORDERS;CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS,"METABOLISM AND NUTRITION DISORDERS;CARDIAC DISORDERS;INJURY, POISONING AND PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS;HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS;RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS",Drug administration error,CARDIOGENIC SHOCK,,STRESS CARDIOMYOPATHY,,DRUG ADMINISTRATION ERROR,,CARDIAC ARREST,,VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION,,METABOLIC ACIDOSIS,ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY,HEPATIC FAILURE,HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY,,,,Y,LT,EPINEPHRINE(PS),EPINEPHRINE(PS),EPINEPHRINE(PS),EPINEPHRINE:CISATRACURIUM BESILATE:ATROPINE:PROPOFOL:SUFENTANIL:KETAMINE,ATROPINE:CISATRACURIUM BESILATE:KETAMINE:PROPOFOL:SUFENTANIL,EPINEPHRINE,EPINEPHRINE,,,,PS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MYLAN,,,,,KETAMINE,KETAMINE,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SUFENTANIL,SUFENTANIL,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PROPOFOL,PROPOFOL,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ATROPINE,ATROPINE,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE,CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE,,,,,,,,

Unclear why he had intoxicated himself, the patient stated that it was not a suicidal attempt. At arrival to the ER it has passed nearly 23 hours since the intake of tablets why no gastric lavage nor treatment with activated charcoal is performed. 

The Poison Information Center informed that the only tablet that still could be active was Janumet which could cause lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia. The other tablets had been taken in a too low dose to be expected to have any effect and had too short elimination time to achieve any effect at present.

This case pertains to an 88-year-old male patient who developed rhabdomyolysis following a drug interaction between Amiodaron (amiodarone), Ciclosporin A  (ciclosporine) and Simvastatin.

The patient had a medical history of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidaemia and tachyarrhythmia absoluta. Non company co-suspect medication included Amiodaron for tachyarrhythmia absoluta and Ciclosporin A for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Concomitant medications were not reported.

On 06-NOV-2014, the laboratory investigation revealed glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and aspartate aminotransferase as 27 U/l and 30 U/l respectively. On 08-NOV-2014, the patient commenced treatment with Amiodaron 200 Milligram (form: unknown) orally three times daily for tachyarrhythmia absoluta. On an unknown date, the frequency of Amiodaron was reduced to once daily. On an unknown date, the patient started taking Ciclosporin A 75 milligram (form: unknown) once daily for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. On an unknown date, the dose of Ciclosporin A was reduced to 50 milligram. On an unknown date, the patient started taking Simvastatin 40 milligram (form: unknown) once daily orally for hyperlipidaemia. After a few days, the patient experienced increased muscle weakness as well as a massive increase of creatine kinase (CK) (CK-MB-Quotient normal), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) as well as GPT was seen. On 12-NOV-2014, the patient's LDH and creatine kinase was measured as 223 U/l and 285 U/l respectively.

Comment: Company Comment:
The patient's underlying uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, advanced age of 74 years, obesity (BMI, 39.57), medical history of arteriosclerotic heart disease, high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and family history of heart disease (father, mother) are major risk factors for myocardial infarction and may provide a likely explanation for the event. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase cardiovascular risk 2-4-fold compared with the general population - a risk level that may compare with that of non-diabetic people who have already suffered a myocardial infarct (1).

Metabolic acidosis [Metabolic acidosis] 
Acute kidney injury [Renal failure acute]

Case Description:
This case with Manufacturer Control Number 2014HINLIT1048 from INDIA corresponds to a 51-year-old adult female patient who reported Drug interaction, metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury while after receiving Tenofovir 300mg once daily for the treatment of HIV infection.

The reported events resulted in hospitalization of the patient, hence considered to be a serious case.

This case was reported in Journal of Pharmacology and 
Pharmacotherapeutics. (RPI: ID-803111061).

As per the report, a 51-year-old woman experienced metabolic acidosis secondary to acute kidney injury during concomitant therapy with tenofovir and ganciclovir.

The woman, with a history of HIV 1 infection, had been receiving tenofovir 300mg [route not stated], emtricitabine, and efavirenz for 5 years. Fourteen days prior to presentation, ganciclovir 250mg orally and fluconazole were started for loss of appetite and dysphagia (CMV infection suspected). She presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of vomiting and decreased food intake with altered sensorium of 1-day duration.  On examination, she had pallor. Her pulse rate was 114 per minute and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Her blood glucose levels were low, so she was started on 25% dextrose and her sensorium improved. She was started on oxygen inhalation, IV fluids sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride and Ryle's tube feeding. On day 1, tests showed blood urea of 49 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and arterial blood gas (ABG), suggesting metabolic acidosis. On the 2nd day, blood urea was 68 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.9 mg/dL. On the 3rd day, an abdominal ultrasound showed post left nephrectomy and grade II renal parenchymal changes in the right kidney. MRI revealed diffuse cerebral atrophy. Cotrimoxazole was added for prevention of opportunistic infection. On the 4th day, serum creatinine and blood urea gradually increased to 2 mg/dL and 69 mg/dL, respectively and she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury with a rise in the renal function parameters.

On the 4th day, ganciclovir and antiretroviral therapy (ART) were withdrawn. On the 5th day, she was symptomatically better and was conscious and coherent. Serum creatinine reduced from 2 mg/dL to 1.7 mg/dL and blood urea decreased from 69 mg/dL to 51 mg/dL. On the 5th day, she was discharged on request.

Events onset of latency was unknown days at the time of this report.

Dechallenge was positive and rechallenge detail was unknown at the time of this report. The outcome of the events was resolved at the time of this report.

Case outcome: Resolved.

Conclusion:

As ganciclovir or valganciclovir are the drugs of choice for Cytomegalovirus infections that are commonly encountered opportunistic infections in HIV-infected individuals, in whom tenofovir-based ART is better tolerated (the most commonly employed ART regimen), this interaction assumes clinical relevance. To the best of our knowledge, there is no case report published in this regard, and this would be the first one. Therefore, whenever a patient is on tenofovir-based ART, ganciclovir or valganciclovir co-administration should be avoided. In case ganciclovir or valganciclovir are indicated for treatment of the co-infection, then tenofovir may be substituted with any other appropriate antiretroviral drug, to preserve renal function.

Author Comment:

""After reviewing the case details, a drug interaction was suspected between tenofovir and ganciclovir, which might have caused a rise in the tenofovir concentrations and led to acute kidney injury"".

Medical reviewer comment:
Serious, published literature reported case of metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury and drug interaction after administration of tenofovir (suspect product, brand name, manufacturer, marketing authorisation holder unspecified) for HIV infection and concomitant administration of ganciclovir, fluconazole for treatment of cytomegalovirus infection. On withdrawal of tenofovir and ganciclovir, tl e~SS patient's condition improved. The case is suspected, possibly related. The events except metabolic acidosis are unlisted.

Case Description:
This is a verbatim report as received by Validus from Novartis:

Case Description: Mother case:-Case number PHHY20151N004285, is an initial literature report received on 13 Jan 2015. The author discussed about headache caused by ephedrine. This report refers to a 35-year-old female patient (second gravida).

Her current conditions included Takayasu's arteritis (TA), aortic regurgitation (AR) and hypertension for 5 years. Her medications included methyldopa 500 mg tablet, amlodipine 5 mg and extended release metoprolol 50 mg, each, twice daily (manufacturer unknown for the drugs). On an unknown date, she was posted for emergency caesarean  delivery in the view of intra-uterine growth retardation and foetal tachycardia. Her pulse rate was 114/min and BP was 183/78 mmHg in right arm supine position. Volume of upper limb pulses appeared to be bilaterally equal on palpation. However, right radial pulse was collapsing in nature along with radio-femoral delay. Grade four early diastolic murmur, loudest in aortic area, with palpable thrill-radiating to left sternal border was present.   
Examination of other systems and investigations were unremarkable. Two dimensional (2D) echocardiogram revealed narrowing of thoracic and abdominal aorta to 9 mm with a high blood flow velocity of 2.0 m/s. Ascending aorta and aortic arch were dilated along with moderate AR. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58% with normal biventricular systolic function and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Doppler performed 5 years back showed high resistant flows in common, internal and external carotid arteries bilaterally, with possible proximal stenosis of right subclavian artery (SCA).  
 Baseline vitals in the operating room were as follows: Heart rate of 115/min, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) of 188/78 mmHg in right upper limb and SPO2 of 97%. Anaesthetic plan was lumbar epidural anaesthesia with invasive radial arterial BP monitoring prior to placing the epidural. Since the doppler report showed possible stenosis of right SCA, left radial arterial line was secured and the invasive BP (IBP) was 112/55 mmHg. Lower limb arterial monitoring was not considered due to narrowing of thoraco-abdominal aorta. Epidural catheter was secured in L1-L2 intervertebral space, and the position was confirmed with test dose of 3 ml of 2% preservative free lignocaine. Patient was positioned supine with a wedge under the right buttock. To achieve a sensory block up to T6 level, 10 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was given in 5 ml increments every 10 minutes (manufacturer unknown). There was a drop in IBP to 80/40 mmHg along with a drop of NIBP to 122/60 mmHg after the epidural over 10 minutes. The drop in IBP was treated with ephedrine boluses (manufacturer unknown) at a dose of 6 mg to avoid any cerebral or utero-placental hypoperfusion. There was ill-sustained increase in IBP and NIBP after each bolus (3 boluses provided). BP  increased up to 122/64 mmHg, while the NIBP increased up to 198/94 mmHg after the third bolus of ephedrine. Patient complained of headache after each bolus of ephedrine. Possibility of over treating IBP leading to headache was considered after ruling out possibilities of monitoring error. On table doppler ultrasound of upper limb arteries was performed specifically looking at the luminal diameter and amplitude of pulsations. Both were reduced in the left radial and axillary artery when compared to the right radial and axillary artery. Right radial pulsation was collapsing in nature, which was expected in AR. Thereafter, we considered treating using the NIBP values of the right upper limb. Meanwhile, the baby delivered was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit in view of prematurity (see baby case number- PHHY2015IN006735). Rest of the intra-operative period was uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in a high dependency unit. Post-operative aortogram revealed normal right SCA and diffuse disease of the left distal SCA, which confirmed our intra-operative findings. Action take with the drugs and the outcome of the events was not reported. The author commented that in cases of TA, bedside doppler helps to select appropriate site for intra-arterial BP monitoring, where achieving haemodynamic stability was crucial. Scanning carotids for stenosis may prompt the anaesthesiologist to avoid hyperextension of the neck during laryngoscopy.

This case was received by Novartis on 13-Jan-2015 and was forwarded to Validus as a serious case on 22-Jan-2015.

Information has been received from the French Health Authority (agency #NT20150126) on
27-FEB-2015 regarding a 28-year-old female patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The patient was treated by efavirenz (+) emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (ATRIPLA) film coated tablet (strength:600mg/200mg/245 mg, oral, lot#, dose and frequency were not reported) since 27-OCT-2011 in the context of her HIV infection. In June 2012, the patient underwent an insertion procedure with etonogestrel implant (NEXPLANON) 68 mg subcutaneously for contraception (lot#, dose and frequency were not reported).

In January 2015, the patient was pregnant (5 weeks amenorrhea) and it was considered inefficacy of the progestogen contraceptive. Drug interaction between efavirenz (+) emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (ATRIPLA) and etonogestrel implant (NEXPLANON) was reported but not coded by the agency. The patients last menstrual periods was in January 2015 and
estimated dates of conception (EDC) and estimated dates of delivery (EDD) were unknown. The patient consulted the family planning on [RED] for a drug induced elective termination of pregnancy at 5 weeks of amenorrhea. Action taken of etonogestrel implant (NEXPLANON) was unknown. Therapy with efavirenz (+) emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (ATRIPLA) was continued.

The outcome of the events was unknown. French Health Authority coded pregnancy and drug ineffective, checked other serious medical situation (medically significant) as serious criteria and considered these events as questionably related to etonogestrel implant (NEXPLANON) and efavirenz (+) emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (ATRIPLA).

THE PATIENT WAS PREVIOUSLY IN GOOD HEALTH.
UNKNOWN DATES:  THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL WITH A FEVER OF 39 DEGREES CELSIUS, HEADACHE, ANOREXIA AND VOMITING.  THE  DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE BACTERIAL MENINGITIS WAS CONSIDERED AND CONFIRMED BY A NEUTROPHILIC PLEOCYTOSIS, AN ELEVATED PROTEIN AND REDUCED GLUCOSE CONTENT IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID.  A GRAM STAIN REVEALED GRAM NEGATIVE DIPLOCOCCI.  CEFTRIAXONE WAS STARTED IV, 125 MG/KG, QD (A SINGLE 30 MINUTE DAILY INFUSION).  NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID BY CULTURE.  AFTER 4 DAYS THE CEFTRIAXONE WAS REPLACED BY BENZYLPENICILLIN.  ON DAY 4 THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF ABDOMINAL PAIN.  ON DAY 10 THE URINARY CALCULUS WAS SPONTNEOUSLY ELIMINATED.  INFRARED SPECTROPHOTOMETRY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE STONE CONSISTED ALMOST COMPLETELY OF CEFTRIAXONE.  NO METABOLIC DISORDER WAS FOUND - URINARY CALCIUM, OXALATE, URIC ACID AND CYSTINE EXCRETIONS WERE NORMAL.  URINARY TRACT AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASONOGRAPHY WERE NORMAL 10 DAYS AFTER ADMISSION.

This 40 year old woman with a past medical history of mitral valve prolapse, giardiasis and allergies to sulfa and Demerol was treated with Omeprazole 20-60 mg tablet po daily for heartburn and retrosternal pressure. The 20 mg dosage was started a few months ago. This did not help and the dose was increased to 40 mg daily, which worked for about two weeks. The dose was then increased to 60 mg daily . The patient then experienced a bad episode of retrosternal pressure (retrosternal pain) on the 60 mg dosage and the dosage was reduced to 40 mg daily resulting symptom reduction.  No concomitant reported, but she had been treated with cimetidine, aluminium hydroxide gel + magnesium hydroxide and bismuth subdalicylate (no dates provided). The patient has not yet recovered. Causal relationship with opmeprazole was assessed as possible by the reporter.

Information has been received concerning a 63 year old male patient, already hospitalized for heart transplantation which had been performed on[RED]  because of CHF due to dliated cardipomyopathy with normal coronary arteries. In post surgical period the patient experienced bilateral pneumonia due to Citrobacter freundii for which, on 01FEB2000, he was placed on with imipenem cilastatin, IV, 500 mg three times daily. Concomitant threrapy included omeprazole, IV, 40 mg daily (start date and indication not reported) and ciprofloxacin, IV, 400 mg daily started on 01FEB2000 for bilateral pneumonia. Other concomitant therapy was getamycin started on 01FEB2000 for pneumonia. On 07-FEB-2000 agranulocytosis was diagnosed (WBC count = 500/mm3 with neutrophils count = 420/mm3). Bone marrow examination showed few cells (poor) with hypoplasia of granulous cells line. On 08-FEB-2000 therapy with imipenem cilastin sodium and omeprzole was discontinued. The patient was placed on therapy with fosfomycin and filgrastim. On 09FEB2000 WBC count was still equal to 300/mm3: consequently fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin were discontinued. Subsequently WBC count increased (500/mm3) on 10FEB2000, 2000/mm3 on 11FEB2000, 17000/mm3 on 12FEB2000) and the patient was considered as having recovered from agranulocytosis. However, because of septic shock, therapy with ciprofloxacin and fosfomycin had been restarted on 13Feb2000. 
On 27FEB2000 WBC count was 27000/mm3. Then from 28FEB2000, cardiocirculatory and respiratory patient's status worsened leading to death on [RED]. Cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure. The reporting physician felt that agranulocytosis might be related to therapy with either  imipenem cilastatin sodium or omeprazole; He felt that cardiorespiratory failure was not related to therapy with imipenem/cilastatin.

Diagnostic studies failed to indicate any etiology and she was referred  to an osteoporosis expert who attributed the event to budesonide.  Budesonide was discontinued and she was placed on montelukast (Singulair) and a beta agonist and was doing well.

CHELONAE ABESSUS CULTURED AT SKIN LESIONS

Narrative:  Addendum for f/u received 27-Aug-2002:  The event is ongoing.  Lot/exp reported.

Addendum for f/u received 05-Sep-2002:  The physician stated that the skin lesions were culture and came up positive for Mycobacterium.  He would like to return the vial for testing.

Addendum for f/u received 06-Sep-2002:  Received from the QA dept:  PTC number added.

Addendum for f/u received 12-Sep-2002:  Follow-up received in the form of culture of abdomen.  Culture positive for moderate growth of mycobacterium chelonae group.  Identification was made at the Oklahoma State Dept of Health.

Addendum for f/u received 23-Oct-2002:  (This is patient 1 of 2)  The pt. has been receiving insulin glargine 14units daily for diabetes for approximately 1yr.  In Jun-2002, she developed a painful inflamed nodule on the left thigh.  Subsequently, she developed a 2nd at an inj. site on the rt thigh, a third on the rt side of her abdomen and a 4th on the upper rt thigh.  Insulin glargine was discontinued and the pt. started Ultra Lente insulin.  She has not had any recurrence of any new nodules since stopping insulin glargine.  The pt. did reuse her syringes prior to development of the 1st nodule.  She was reusing her insulin syringes until the 1st lesion on the left leg appeared.  She stopped reusing the syringes and she also changed to a new vial of insulin glargine.  She was using 2 vials of insulin glargine at the time, only 1 of which was available for analysis.  A biopsy of the abdominal lesion grew Mycobacterium chelonae.  The pt. has had no fever of chills.  Treatment with clarithromycin (Biaxin) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was started.  Physical exam on 05-Sep-2002 revealed the areas were healing, although there is still some induration and drainage.  Physical exam on 24-Sep-2002 also showed one palpable lymph node in the rt groin area approximately 1cm and the other 1cm node in the left inguinal area.  Distal extremities were unremarkable, no joint pathology and no other rashes elsewhere.  There were a number of seborrheic keratoses present throughout the skin.  The physician reported the events ""could represent surface contamination on the skin or could also represent contamination of the vial"".  Medical history includes an allergy to penicillin and she has been a diabetic since 1990.  The pt does not drink or smoke.  Con meds include a diuretic and antihistamine.

Addendum for f/u received 30-Oct-2002:  Received from the New Hamshire Dept of Health states that ""both pts. were utilizing insulin glargine, saw the same internist for their diabetes care and consulted the same dermatologist after suffering the skin lesions"".  The clinical specimens from the 2pts.  were processed by two separate laboratories.  The Oklahoma State Department of Health Public Health Laboratories confirmed M. chelonae.  Isolates of the organisms will be sent to the CDC for further confirmation and sub-speciation.

The dermatologist reports that M. chelonae is a non-virulent organism causing opportunistic infections.  The dermatologist reports that he has seen other similar infections in individuals who have scratched themselves but he is not aware of any other cases in diabetic individuals in his area, regardless of the type of insulin injected (NPH, Lente, and regular insulin).  The 2 vials from the 2nd case were went to the state lab and after 3 weeks, no growth has occurred.  The abscess cultures from the second case have been reclassified as Mycobacterium fortuitum (also non-virulent).  The dermatologist has asked the lab to re-examine the cultures from the 1st case to see if the outcome is the same.

Addendum for f/u received 20-Nov-2002:  F/u received from a physician at the Oklahoma State Board of Health.  The organism was further classified as Mycobacterium chelomae abessus.

Addendum for f/u received 11-Feb-2003:  A faxed copy of the lab. investigation form the Oklahoma Board of health was received.  Also the copy of the CDC lab investigation results.  No new info was reported.

Addendum for f/u received 24-Feb-2003:  (Case has been truncated) F/u received from the QA Dept:  This complaint is for Lantus injection lot number 40W086, expiration date 31-JUL-2003.  This complaint was forwarded to Aventis Pharma, supplier of Lantus, for investigation.  Initially this complaint was treated as a potential expedite, but based on the following investigation this complaint is now categorized as a major complaint.
Investigation Summary:  The batch review gave no indication of problems during the manufacturing process with regard to the reason of the complaint.  The batch review of the microbiological documentation of the manufacturing and filling processes do not show deviations either.  The retention sample was tested.  The content of m-Cresol of the retention sample met the specification.  The complaint sample was received.  One used vial was returned.  The complaint sample and the retention sample were sent to the National Reference Center for Mycobacteria for further testing (microbiological growth of myobacterium chelonae).  The tests were started on 22-OCT-02.  On 12-NOV-02, no bacterial growth was observed in the complaint sample or the retention sample.  Additionally, after spiking a sample with M. chelonae, no growth was observed after 7days.  Further testing was conducted and no growth of mycobacteria could be detected in the complaint sample or the retention sample for this batch number, using specific culture media and incubation temperature for mycobacteria.  Based on the test results it is concluded that Lantus is not a substrate, which supports the growth of mycobacteria.  On the contrary, it shows strong anti-microbial activity against M. chelonae.  Therefore, it can be confirmd that the complaint is not caused by the product or any quality related issues of the drug product itself, but must have other reasons.  
Based on the results of the Frankfurt investigation this complaint cannot be substantiated.

FU received on 18Mar03:

A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) on [RED] after a car accident. He presented multi-trauma and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Concomitant medication at the time of the event included: meropenem, atenolol, heparin-fraction/sodium salt, salbutamol/ipratropium bromide, metoclopramide, ambroxol hydrochloride, and pantoprazole.

On 28Jan03, ten days after his admission to ICU while he was submitted to supportive treatment, he started to take linezolid (Zyvoxid) solution for injection 600 mg twice a day intravenously for the treatment of persistent fever and isolation of Staphylococcus Epidermidis.
After the first dose of linezolid his creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) became 1406 U/liter and, on the following day, it was found to be 18724 U/liter. On 30Jan03, after a total of four doses, linezolid was withdrawn.
Patient's CPK values remained high reaching the maximum value of 36870 U/liter on 01Feb03. He was diagnosed to have rabdomyolysis. A biopsy has been requested by the treating physician but the results were not available. Alkaline diuresis was applied as treatment of the adverse event.
On 03Feb03 the patient was transferred to the chest surgery clinic ward. On the following days the patient started to recover with CPK values gradually decreasing, reaching a value within normal range on 11Feb03. Finally the patient was discharged on [RED], completely recovered from the event.

Despite removal of the catheter and treatment with appropriate antibiotics, the patient exhibited persistent fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia and hypotension and progressive inflammation, pain and palpable crepitus in the left hand. Radiographic evaluation of the left arm revealed gas in the soft tissues of the arm consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. The patient was urgently taken to the operating room for surgical debridement and amputation at the left wrist. His condition was further complicated by acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and respiratory failure. 

His condition gradually improved but he required tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator. Continuous enteral feedings were initiated but high gastric residual volumes were observed and he was judged to be at high risk for aspiration. As was customary in the surgical intensive care unit, 100 mg of FD&C blue No. 1 was added to 1000cc of enteral formula in order to facilitate the detection of gastric aspiration events. The total dose of FD&C blue No. 1 received did not exceed 0.7mg/kg/day. On the 32rd hospital day, a bluish discoloration of both the skin and dialysis ultrafiltrate were noted. Spectrophotometric analysis of the patient's serum (Figure I) and dialysate (not shown) confirmed the presence of FD&C blue No. 1. Enteral feedings were immediately discontinued, but his condition rapidly deteriorated. Despite aggressive volume resuscitation and maximal vasopressor therapy, the patient experienced lactic (metabolic) acidosis, respiratory failure and refractory shock. No source of infection was identified. The patient developed multiple organ failures and expired on hospital day 35.

Case Description:
Case Report received via the RADARS® System.
A 9-month-old male patient (race unspecified) accidentally ingested one tablet of OxyContin (controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride) at approximately 1400 on [RED]. The dose was not specified. Reportedly, the child was found with a white substance around his mouth and was taken to a hospital. He was drowsy with miotic pupils. 
He was given Narcan (naloxone hydrochloride) with a positive response and intravenous fluids (IVF). Later on [RED], an hour after receiving Narcan, the patient regressed to sedation and pinpoint pupils. It was advised there was a potential for central nervous system and respiratory (cns/resp) depression with a sustained-release (sr) preparation (prep) and to give standard dose activated charcoal (sdac). 
It was recommended to observe for 8 - 12 hours, and at least 4 - 6 hours post-Narcan. 
It was also recommended to give a second bolus of Narcan and start a Narcan drip (gtt) to be discontinued (d/c'd) at 0200, 12 hours after ingestion. The bolus and infusion were given and the child was admitted. 
The Narcan infusion was discontinued at 0200 on [RED]. 
The child exhibited no further symptoms and was active and playful on the morning of [RED]. He ate breakfast and was discharged home. 
This case was reported on 21NOV04 and 22NOV04 by a physician in the United States of America via a poison control center. Additional information will not be available.

Patient with a 20 year history of psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome (HLA B27-positive) with a history of gold, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, indomethacin and rofecoxib treatment developed endophthalmitis and Mycobacterium chelonae approximately 4 months following pre-senile cataract extraction of the right eye approximately 5 years post etanercept exposure. A core vitrectomy and capsular biopsy with intravitreal injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime was performed. Gram stain of the vitreous showed rare unidentified mononucleated cells, but no neutrophils or organisms. Treatment with unspecified antibiotics was initiated. Post-operatively a fungus culture revealed bacterial growth and a gram stain showed beaded rods and a positive Kenyoun smear. DNA sequencing identified Mycobacterium chelonae/abscessus complex. The patient underwent a complete vitrectomy, lens explantation capsulectomy, and intravitreal amikacin. TV imipenem, topical gatifloxacin and oral clarithromycin were initiated. Etanercept was discontinued and re-started 6 months later. The physician reported '...this is the first reported case of endophthalmitis associated with etanercept'.

Drug Use Investigation is to collect safety and efficacy information under daily medical practice without intervention.  An investigator, internist, reported that an 87-year-old male patient had dry cough from Mar2005. Viccillin (ampicillin sodium) and Ciproxan (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) were administered for pneumonia on 04Apr2005 and 06Apr2005 respectively. Ciproxan and Viccillin were discontinued on 08Apr2005 and 11Apr2005. Meropen (meropenem trihydrate) was administered between 24Apr2005 and 27ARP2005. As he did not improve it, he consulted the reporter's hospital on [RED]. He was diagnosed as having interstitial pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), so that hospitalization was required on the day.   He was placed on NPPV (noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) and Elaspol (sivelestat sodium hydrate) was administered. His condition deteriorated, and steroid pulse therapy was started. The patient improved temporary, but ended in on a respirator. After that, pyrexia and respiratory status aggravated were noted. Sputum culture revealed gram-positive cocci, so that Vancomycin hydrochloride was started on 04May2005. As MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcal aureus test) was detected, Vancomycin hydrochloride was switched to Zyvox (linezolid) 1200mg/day BID intravenously on 05May2005. On 07May2005, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis, for which Propofol was discontinued and Lasix (furosemide) was started on the day. Zyvox was continued unchanged in response to the event, but eventually discontinued on 09May2005, and Vancomycin hydrochloride was resumed on 10May2005. On [RED], the patient died owing to respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis and congestion, as autopsy revealed. Vancomycin hydrochloride, Rocephin, Solu-Medrol, Elaspol and Lasix were administered until his death. The event, rhabdomyolysis did not resolved until then.   The reporting internist classified the event, rhabdomyolysis, as serious as hospitalization required/prolonged, and assessed the causality with Zyvox as unknown but related to unspecified concomitant drug. The event, respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis and congestion, was assessed as unrelated to Zyvox. No more information is available at present.    Follow-up (11Apr2007):  This is a follow up report of the case from Drug Use Investigation of Zyvox (linezolid). Follow up information is as follows;  The patient's subject ID was confirmed to be 0436.  AE#1 changed to ""rhabdomyolysis aggravated"" from rhabdomyolysis.  As for the event rhabdomyolysis, the symptoms such as muscle pain were not conformed since the patient lost consciousness under control of intubation. However, the diagnosis was made based on acute increase in CPK as high as 861 IU/L. The investigator suspected Propofol as a cause of the event in consideration to the timing of administration and thought Zyvox as unlikely to the event.  The investigator judged that another event, respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis and congestion, was due to underlying disease as well as concurrent diseases.  As additional concomitnat drug the pation was taking Lasix (furosemide).  Anaemia and platelets decreased were newly added as new information on patient history.

Acute Renal Papillary Necrosis with Complete Bilateral Ureteral Obstruction in a Child. Urology 2007;69(3):575.e11-575.e12.    A 9-year-old white girl presented to a local hospital with a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and erythematous rash on her chest and back. She was suspected of having meningococcal septicemia and was started on ceftriaxone intravenously, as well as paracetamol and ibuprofen orally. Her pyrexia quickly settled, as did her rash. She remained well perfused, with normal blood pressure, and blood cultures showed no growth. However, poor urine output was noted during her stay that had progressed at 48 hours into the admission to complete anuria, with biochemical renal failure. She was transferred to a children's hospital. On arrival, she was remarkably well, apart from abdominal pain. Her urea was 12.0 mmol/L (normal range 2.5 to 8.5), her creatinine was 570 umol/L (normal range 30 to 140), and a full blood count was normal. A urethral catheter was passed in the bladder, but no urine was obtained. Early ultrasonography showed mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. An abdominal x-ray showed no evidence of radiopaque renal calculi. Intravenous urography demonstrated the uptake of the contrast at 25 minutes after injection and a dense nephrogram with minimally dilated ureters visualized for at least 12 hours; no contrast entered the bladder. Renal Doppler traces were normal, and repeat ultrasound scanning now revealed bilateral papillary irregularity.  The bladder was filled through the urethral catheter with normal saline, and the ultrasound scan showed bilateral echogenic debris at the vesicoureteral junction. Cystoscopy was performed, and inflamed edematous ureteral openings were visualized. On insertion of a catheter into the ureters, debris escaped into the bladder, and bilateral double-J stents were left in place. Postoperatively, the child became extremely polyuric. Within 72 hours, her urine output was normal, and her renal function had returned to within normal limits. At the 6-week review, her renal function remained within normal limits. A repeat ultrasound examination showed normal renal echostructure with no hydronephrosis. Elective removal of the double-J stents was performed 4 weeks later. At 3 years of follow-up she has had no further complications.  As per Gordon et al, the papillary necrosis most probably had a multifactorial etiology.  Dehydration and septicemia, which can cause pappillary ischemia, together with the administration of ibuprofen, paracetamol, and ceftriaxone may have led to the development of this condition.

The patient was taking OxyContin (controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride) 80mg for an unknown indication starting in JUN2001 until 01JAN02.  On[RED], the patient died from an unreported cause.   Due to the fatal outcome from an unspecified cause, this case was rated to be serious. Additional information is being requested. ***Follow-up was received 14MAY2008 from the decedent's physician, Deputy Coroner's office and Medical Examiner in the United States of America. According to the physician, the decedent was taking OxyContin three 80 mg twice daily and one 40 mg twice daily from 31AUG2000 to 17DEC2001 for chronic back pain and fibromyalgia.  According to the Coroner's report, the decedent's current medical condition was significant for systemic lupus and her chief complaints were massive headaches, lethargy and pain up and down her spine. Relevant past medical history included a hysterectomy and appendectomy. Concomitant medications included multiple pain medications (unspecified) as well as unspecified medications to help her systemic lupus. The decedent had no history of cancer, nor did she smoke or drink alcohol. According to the Coroner's report, on 01JAN2002 the decedent's husband helped her into bed where she was to take a nap. The husband came to check on the decedent and noted she was having difficulty breathing. He described her breathing as short and shallow and stated blood began to flow out of her nose. The husband had an unsuccessful attempt of waking the decedent and at that point called 911 and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The decedent was brought into the emergency room at approximately 2155 hours not breathing, unconscious, and unresponsive with cardiac life support measures underway. The physician called the time of death on[RED] at[RED] hours.  Toxicological results obtained upon hospital admission on 01JAN2002 revealed: blood oxycodone 2.14 mg/L effective level: (0.01-0.10 mg/L), carisoprodol 5.8 mg/L effective level: (10 - 40 mg/L), oxymorphone 0.03 mg/L effective level: none reported, meprobamate 5.3 mg/L effective level: (10-25 mg/L), citalopram 0.59 mg/L effective level: (.04 -.10 mg/L), amitriptyline 0.10 mg/L effective level: (0.05-0.20 mg/L), nortriptyline  0.05 mg/L effective level: (0.07-0.25 mg/L).

This report is based on information received from Endo Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer number 2007EN000147.

A physician reported that a 35-year-old female patient had been found dead. 

The cause of death was determined to be acute poly drug intoxication by the coroner's office. 
The patient was taking Lunesta (eszopiclone) 3 mg HS since an unknown date for an unspecified indication, Opana ER (oxymorphone HCI) 40 mg BID since 7-Apr-2007 for chronic pain, Opana (oxymorphone HCL) 5 mg Q12H since 7-Apr-2007 for breakthrough pain, an unknown dose of Vicodin ES (hydrocodone / acetaminophen) QD since an unknown date for chronic pain, Duragesic (fentanyl) patch 100 mcg every 3 days since Apr-2007 for chronic pain, 
Arava (leflunomide) 20 mg QID since an unknown date for rheumatoid arthritis, amitriptyline 300 mg QHS on an unknown date for an unspecified indication, Provigil (modafinil) 200 mg on an unknown date for an unspecified indication, Zoloft (sertraline) 100 mg QID on an unknown date for an unspecified indication, an unknown dose of Levoxyl (levothyroxine) on an unknown date for an unspecified indication, and Klonopin (clonazepam) 2 mg TID on an unknown date for an unspecified indication. 
The patient's medical history also included fibromyalgia, alcohol and tobacco use, allergies to Rocephin (ceftriaxone) and penicillin and prior obesity which resolved with a gastric bypass surgery in [RED].

On 07-Apr-2007, the patient complained that she was not getting sufficient pain relief from Vicodin ES. She was prescribed Opana ER 40 bid and Opana (immediate release) 5 mg Q12H for breakthrough pain. 
The patient was advised to discontinue Arava. 
The physician saw her again on 8-May-2007 for a routine visit and she appeared well, while reviewing her chart, the physician became concerned and realized that she was taking a lot of opiates. 
The physician therefore told the patient to discontinue the Duragesic patch and that she must be ""weaned"" off the Opana ER. 
The patient did not seem interested in reducing her medication load at this time, and the physician did not feel confident that the patient was following her instruction. 
The physician however, told her to take Opana ER 40 mg in the morning and the 20 mg in the evening and to continue her Opana 5 mg TID until her current supply of medication ran out. 

The physician felt that she had enough medication to last until Jun-2007 at which time she would evaluate her again with the plan of discontinuing Opana ER completely. 
The physician was informed that the patient had been found dead at home on [RED]. 
The reporting physician was unsure what might have caused the death. 
A clerk at the county coroner's office stated that the cause of death was acute poly drug intoxication. Autopsy results are pending.

Follow-up information received from Pfizer on 2-May-2008 that included information provided to Pfizer by Endo Pharmaceuticals:
The physician reported that the autopsy was performed on 10-May-2007. 
The overall significant findings were mild cerebral swelling, mild pulmonary congestion with minimal pulmonary edema, well-healed abdominal surgical scars, status post gastric bypass surgery, status post appendectomy, well healed surgical scar on right wrist, status post pacemaker implantation and hyperostosis frontalis interna. 
The coroner concluded that the estimated date of death was [RED] at [RED] hours. 

The cause of death was ruled to be acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of amitriptilyne, nortriptyline, sertraline, norsertraline, diphenhydramine, methadone, chlordiazepoxide, aminoclonazepam, clonazepam, demoxepam, nordiazepam and hydrocodone. 
The coroner revealed the manner of death was by accident. 
The toxicology report in this case did not reveal detectable levels of morphine or oxymorphone in any of the submitted postmortem samples. 

Toxicology report: The amitriptyline level of postmortem blood was 2.2 mg/L, peripheral blood 2.5 mg/L, Liver 55 mg/kg and stomach contents <2.5 mg. 
The nortriptyline level of postmortem blood was 1.5 mg/L, peripheral blood 1.2 mg/L, liver 50 mg/kg and stomach contents <12 mg. The sertraline level of postmortem blood was 1.5 mg/L, peripheral blood 1.4 mg/L, liver 58 mg/kg and stomach contents 3.4 mg. 
The norsertraline level of postmortem blood was 2.6 mg/L, peripheral blood 2.6 mg/L, liver >90 mg/kg and stomach contents <5.0 mg. 

The coroner remarked that the amitriptyline, nortriptyline, sertraline and norsertraline levels in this case are consistent with levels reported as fatal. 
The diphenhydramine level in postmortem blood was 0.49 mg/L, peripheral blood 0.65 mg/L, liver 8.9 mg/kg and stomach contents <2.5 mg. 

The coroner remarked that the diphenhydramine levels in this case exceeds levels reported as therapeutic, but are less than those reported as fatal. 
Lidocaine, methadone, chlordiazepoxide, aminoclonazepam, demoxepam, nordiazepam were detected in postmortem blood. 
The aminoclonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and demoxepam levels in postmortem blood were reported as being in the therapeutic range. 
The clonazepam, nordiazepam and methadone levels were reported as being in the sub-therapeutic range. 
Hydrocodone was detected in postmortem blood. Codeine (total) and morphine (total) were not detected in postmortem blood. 
Postmortem blood levels of ethanol, barbiturates, cocaine and cannabinoids were reported as negative. No further information anticipated.

The male patient demanded sex with his wife at least three times a day after he began taking sildenafil and he has been ordered to pay his wife $232,000 in compensation.  The male patient was found to have subjected his 53-year-old wife to more than 18 months of physical and sexual abuse.  It included 60 threats to kill her of she did not meet his sexual needs.  The wife of the patient reports that ""those tablets changed him and he started to treat me like a slave.""  The wife reports that the horrific mental and physical abuse began in 2001 after he husband began taking sildenafil.  She reports that ""he was a gentleman and a good man, but then he started taking the tablets.""  She reports that he was taking up to three sildenafil tablets a day.  His sex drive increased dramatically and she was forced into hundreds of sex acts.  She reports that ""after taking those tablets, he told me it was very important for him to have sex three or four times a day.""  The wife reports that her husband was a good man who treated her well, until Apr2001, when he started taking sildenafil. ""Until April he was very correct to me, there was no violence, there was no pressure of any kind to do anything"" she told the court.  The judge detailed the litany of abuse, which included more than 200 sexual assaults, some of which would last for 40 minutes.  He found that there were three acts of sexual assault a week, as well as other sex acts.  He beat her with a curtain rod, a stick and his shotgun.  She reports that ""he put his gun in my mouth and said: One day, I will kill you.""  She also claimed that he lit matches and threw them at her body.  The court heard that, when she told him on 21Sep2002, she was leaving, he tried to strangle her.  He also cut off her hair, stating: ""This is your punishment for not completely satisfying me and this is what I will always do.""  The court found that the wife was assaulted and had suffered a significant and chronic post-traumatic shock disorder, as well as depression.  The patient was ordered to pay his wife $232,791 for the pain and suffering he had inflicted on her, her medical costs, and to punish him for his wrongdoing.

THE PATIENT'S PAST AND ONGOING MEDICAL HISTORY WAS NOT REPORTED.  THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTUAL PREVALENCE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF A TREATMENT INTERRUPTION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH PERINATALLY ACQUIRED HIV-1 INFECTION.  BETWEEN JANUARY 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 2004, 405 PATIENTS WITH PERINATAL HIV-1 INFECTION, WERE ENROLLED IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. SEVENTY TWO PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A TREATMENT INTERRUPTION. THE CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN FOLLOWED AT CLINICS DURING THIS PERIOD WITHOUT AGE LIMITATION WERE INCLUDED. CHILDREN WERE ANALYZED BECAUSE THEY SATISFIED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 6 MONTHS BEFORE TREATMENT INTERRUPTION (TI); (2) ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICATIONS WERE DISCONTINUED FOR GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 3 MONTHS; AND (3) CLINICAL DATA WERE AVAILABLE BEFORE AND DURING THE TI. WHEN A PATIENT HAD GREATER THAN 1 TI DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, ONLY THE FIRST EPISODE WAS INCLUDED. THE BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS INCLUDED MALE (29 PATIENTS), FEMALE (43 PATIENTS), MEAN AGE (12.8 YEARS), NON-HISPANIC WHITE (9 PATIENTS), NON-HISPANIC BLACK (30 PATIENTS), HISPANIC (32 PATIENTS) AND OTHER ETHINICITY (1 PATIENT). THE PATIENTS HAD RECEIVED ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMEN BEFORE -TWELVE PATIENTS HAD RECEIVED NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS (NRTIS), 24 PATIENTS HAD RECEIVED NRTIS AND PROTEASE INHIBITOR (PI), 12 PATIENTS HAD RECEIVED NRTIS AND NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITOR (NNRTI) AND 24 PATIENTS HAD RECEIVED NRTIS, PIS AND NNRTI. SIXTY PERCENT (43 OF 72) OF PATIENTS REMAINED OFF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT (17 OF  72) OF PATIENTS HAD HIV-1RNA LESS THAN 400 COPIES PER ML, AND THE REMAINING 55 (76%) PATIENTS HAD DETECTABLE HIV-1 RNA  GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 400 COPIES PER ML AT THE TIME OF THE TI. BEFORE THE TI, 60 (80%) PATIENTS RECEIVED HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL (HAART) AND 12 (20%) PATIENTS RECEIVED NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS (NRTIS) ALONE. THE MEAN LENGTH OF THE TI WAS 15.9 MONTHS (RANGE: 3-56 MONTHS).   THIS IS ONE OF THE PATIENTS ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY. ON UNKNOWN DATES, THE PATIENT COMMENCED ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT WITH TENOFOVIR AND SAQUINAVIR+RITONAVIR (ROUTE, FORM AND DOSE UNSPECIFIED). THE PATIENT DISCONTINUED TENOFOVIR AND SAQUINAVIR+RITONAVIR BECAUSE OF A BEHAVIOR ISSUE (DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS REFUSAL TO SWALLOW PILLS OR RESISTANCE TO COMMANDS BY PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS). HER CD4+T-CELL COUNT (CD4%) WAS 108 (19%) AND HIV-1 RNA LEVEL WAS 9419 COPIES PER ML AT TIME OF THE TI. AFTER 1 YEAR WITHOUT MEDICATION, SHE RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI PNEUMONIA (PCP) WITH A CD4+ T-CELL COUNT (CD4%) OF 3/MICROLITRE (1%) AND PLASMA HIV-1 RNA LEVEL OF 246 343 COPIES PER ML. THE PATIENT RESUMED ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY AFTER TREATMENT FOR HER AIDS-DEFINING ILLNESSES.  THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENT OUTCOME AND TREATMENT WITH SAQUINAVIR, RITONAVIR AND TENOFOVIR.  THE PHYSICIAN ASSESSED THE EVENT OF PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI PNEUMONIA AS SERIOUS AS IT REQUIRED HOSPITALISATION.

This case was derived from a scientific literature and describes clinically significant adverse events from a drug interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir sulfate-ritonavir in two patients.   This report pertains to a 32-year-old female patient (patient 2 of 2) who had drug interaction with atazanavir sulfate, ritonavir and quetiapine and also experienced sedation and mental confusion. The patient also received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine therapies.  The patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, anxiety disorder, and a history of intravenous drug abuse was noted to have mental confusion and increased sedation during a visit to her methadone clinic. Three months before this visit, quetiapine had been added to the patient's anti-anxiety regimen because citalopram and clonazepam had failed to control her symptoms. Her quetiapine dose was gradually increased to 600 mg per day, and her stable regimen of citalopram 20 mg per day and clonazepam 1 mg 4 times per day was continued. She was also taking maintenance methadone 135 mg per day and dronabinol 2.5 mg twice daily (for the past several months) for appetite stimulation.  The patient subsequently started highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Before starting this therapy, the patient was alert and oriented, with no signs of sedation or confusion noted during a clinic visit. Her cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count was 260cells/mm3.  The patient began a daily regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, atazanavir sulfate 300 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg. Within days of initiating HAART, the patient began to experience increased sedation and mental confusion. Concern was raised that the patient had relapsed into drug abuse, and her 2-year-old son was removed from her custody 3 weeks after starting HAART, despite repeatedly negative urine toxicology screening test results at her methadone clinic.  The patient ultimately stopped quetiapine therapy on her own due to her suspicion that it was contributing to her symptoms. She experienced complete resolution of her mental status changes over several days despite continuation of all her other drugs. Her son was returned to her custody.  The patient had significant central nervous system toxicity, manifested as mental confusion and sedation, was experienced after a ritonavir containing antiretroviral regimen was added to relatively high-dose quetiapine therapy. Although the patient was receiving several psychotropic drugs at the time, her symptoms resolved after the sole discontinuation of quetiapine, suggesting quetiapine was at least partially responsible.  Overall, the author felt that in both the cases the temporal relationship, the similarity of the symptoms with known quetiapine toxicities, and the resolution of symptoms after drug discontinuation were evidence of a possible correlation.   As per the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale the adverse effects experienced by the patient were probably related to an interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir sulfate-ritonavir.  Author comment: In both cases, we believe that adverse effects resulted from high concentrations of quetiapine secondary to inhibition of CYP3A4. Metabolic and neuropsychiatric toxicities are well described with quetiapine therapy and generally occur at higher doses, which result in higher serum concentrations. Both ritonavir and atazanavir sulfate are known inhibitors of CYP3A4, which is the enzyme primarily responsible for quetiapine metabolism. As ritonavir is the more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, we suspect it played the most significant role in these interactions.  Literary citation: Pollack TM, McCoy C, Stead W. Clinically significant adverse events from a drug interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir sulfate-ritonavir in two patients. Pharmacotherapy 2009 Nov 1;29(11):1386-91.  BMS medical evaluation comment: This patient developed sedation and confusion while on therapy with HAART and quetiapine; drug interaction was reported. As discussed by authors, since both ritonavir and atazanvir are known inhibitors of CYP3A4 and metabolism of quetiapine occurs primarily through CYP3A4 pathway, a drug interaction was considered possible. This could have led to higher concentration of quetiapine that resulted in confusion and sedation.",,SEDATION:DRUG INTERACTION:CONFUSIONAL STATE,CONFUSIONAL STATE:DRUG INTERACTION:SEDATION,DISTURBANCES IN CONSCIOUSNESS NEC:INTERACTIONS:CONFUSION AND DISORIENTATION,NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS NEC:DELIRIA (INCL CONFUSION):THERAPEUTIC AND NONTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS (EXCL TOXICITY),GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS:NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS:PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS,,DRUG INTERACTION,,SEDATION,,CONFUSIONAL STATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,OT,ATAZANAVIR:EMTRICITABINE(PS):QUETIAPINE:RITONAVIR:TENOFOVIR,ATAZANAVIR:EMTRICITABINE(PS):QUETIAPINE:RITONAVIR:TENOFOVIR,ATAZANAVIR:EMTRICITABINE(PS):QUETIAPINE:RITONAVIR:TENOFOVIR,EMTRICITABINE:QUETIAPINE:RITONAVIR:ATAZANAVIR:TENOFOVIR,CITALOPRAM:CLONAZEPAM:DRONABINOL:METHADONE,EMTRICITABINE,EMTRICITABINE,EMTRICITABINE,,,PS,,,,200,MG,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,TENOFOVIR,TENOFOVIR,TENOFOVIR,,,SS,,,,300,MG,Approximately 15months,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,CITALOPRAM,CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE,CITALOPRAM,,,C,,,,20,MG,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,CLONAZEPAM,CLONAZEPAM,CLONAZEPAM,,,C,,,,1,MG,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,METHADONE,,,C,,,,135,MG,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,DRONABINOL,DRONABINOL,ATAZANAVIR,ATAZANAVIR,RITONAVIR,RITONAVIR,QUETIAPINE,QUETIAPINE,,

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) is typically characterized by the idiopathic loss of hearing, either unilaterally or bilaterally, that can develop over minutes, hours, or days.  It is theorized that SSHL can be triggered by several different mechanisms that include mechanical cochlear injury, fluctuations of blood flow within the cochlea, viral infection, and associated autoimmune disorders.  One additional theory that has been documented via case report is drug-induced SSHL.  In this article, the authors reported two cases of acute, bilateral methadone-induced hearing loss.  Both patients were brought to the hospital after being found unresponsive due to a presumed overdose of an unknown drug.  Any number of medications could be suspected as the source of SSHL; however, the only ones found in both of these patients' gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) drug screens were methadone and tetrahydrocannibol (THC). Thus, the patients' hearing loss should be attributed to either methadone or THC, or could be the result of concomitant ingestion of the two substances. Because the substances were found in large amounts in both patients, the authors were unable to affirm which drug caused the hearing loss; however, it is the author's belief that the methadone was the probable cause of the patients' sudden hearing loss for the following reasons.  Although limited, there exist several other significant case reports involving opioid-induced SSHL with heroin, cocaine, and more specifically, one case of methadone-induced hearing loss.  A literature search conducted by the authors failed to produce reliably published case reports that would indicate that THC or marijuana may be a cause for sudden hearing loss.A 30-year-old white male, patient one of two from this article, with a history of bipolar disorder, trazodone overdose, and heroin and cannabis abuse was found unresponsive and apneic for an unknown period of time by emergency medical services personnel.  Due to the patient's unresponsiveness, a detailed list of current medications could not be obtained; however, it was believed that he had overdosed on unknown substances.  En route to the hospital the patient was given 2 doses of naloxone 0.4 mg, which produced mild improvement in breathing, but he was still unresponsive.  Two minutes prior to arrival, the patient became mildly responsive and appeared to be agitated.  On arrival at the emergency department (ED), the patient was in extreme distress, with central nervous system (CNS) depression and bilateral hearing loss. The ED physicians attempted to obtain a history from the patient; however, he kept screaming, ""I can't hear you. Please help me, help me!"".  The patient's heart rate and respiratory rate were elevated (138 beats/min, 34 breaths/min, respectively).  The medical team proceeded to place a Foley catheter.  With oxygen saturation dropping into the 60s, the patient was sedated and rapidly intubated for respiratory failure.  Medications used for intubation included etomidate 20 mg intravenously and a total vecuronium dose of 20 mg.  Results of an initial basic metabolic panel, including sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, anion gap, glucose, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, were within normal limits.  A urine sample for a rapid in-house urine drug screen was collected following catheterization but prior to intubation and results were presumptively positive for benzodiazepines, THC metabolites, opiates, and methadone.  The patient's acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethyl alcohol concentrations were all undetectable.  These results correlated with information obtained from the patient's wife (patient two of two from this article), who stated that he was on a methadone maintenance program for heroin dependency and the couple had been smoking marijuana and drinking methadone solution.  After contacting the methadone maintenance facility, it was determined that, because the patient had been adherent thus far to his treatment program, he was allowed to receive 27 doses of 140-mg methadone from the clinic the day prior to overdose.  The patient was not given additional naloxone or any activated charcoal in the ED.  After the rapid in-house urine screen results were available, a urine sample was obtained for a comprehensive analysis via GC/MS.  The results came back as follows: highly positive for THC metabolite, small amount of alprazolam, large amount of alpha hydroxyalprazolam, moderate amounts of lidocaine and lidocaine metabolite presumably due to Foley catheter placement, small amount of oxycodone, large amounts of methadone and methadone metabolite, and a moderate amount of metronidazole.  The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer observation.  Six hours after arrival at the ICU, he was in continued acute respiratory depression despite being intubated.  His oxygen saturation remained in the low 90s while he was on 100% oxygen.  The patient's heart rate decreased to 30- 40 beats/min and systolic blood pressure decreased to 60-80 mm Hg, which was treated as possible septic shock and later resolved.  Sedation was weaned roughly 24 hours postarrival and the patient was able to follow commands, demonstrating no further hearing loss, although he subsequently needed to be resedated due to agitation.  The patient was extubated the following day, but his oxygen saturation decreased into the 80s, which required reintubation. Four days later (six days after presentation to the ED) the patient tolerated weaning of sedation, was extubated, and was transferred out of the ICU.",,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS;RESPIRATORY RATE INCREASED;RESPIRATORY FAILURE;DEAFNESS NEUROSENSORY;SEPTIC SHOCK;APNOEA;AGITATION;UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI;HEART RATE INCREASED;OVERDOSE,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS;DEAFNESS NEUROSENSORY;RESPIRATORY RATE INCREASED;RESPIRATORY FAILURE;HEART RATE INCREASED;APNOEA;UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI;AGITATION;SEPTIC SHOCK;OVERDOSE,"HEARING LOSSES;DISTURBANCES IN CONSCIOUSNESS NEC;HEART RATE AND PULSE INVESTIGATIONS;NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS NEC;RESPIRATORY FAILURES (EXCL NEONATAL);PHYSICAL EXAMINATION PROCEDURES AND ORGAN SYSTEM STATUS;BREATHING ABNORMALITIES;ANXIETY SYMPTOMS;OVERDOSES NEC;SEPSIS, BACTERAEMIA, VIRAEMIA AND FUNGAEMIA NEC",INFECTIONS - PATHOGEN UNSPECIFIED;ANXIETY DISORDERS AND SYMPTOMS;NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS NEC;CARDIAC AND VASCULAR INVESTIGATIONS (EXCL ENZYME TESTS);RESPIRATORY DISORDERS NEC;PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND ORGAN SYSTEM STATUS TOPICS;HEARING DISORDERS;PRODUCT USE ISSUES,"NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS;PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS;EAR AND LABYRINTH DISORDERS;INVESTIGATIONS;INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS;INJURY, POISONING AND PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS;RESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS",,UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI,,DEAFNESS NEUROSENSORY,,SEPTIC SHOCK,,RESPIRATORY RATE INCREASED,,RESPIRATORY FAILURE,,APNOEA,DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS,OVERDOSE,AGITATION,HEART RATE INCREASED,,,Y,"HO,LT,OT",MARIJUANA:METHADOSE(PS),CANNABIS SATIVA SUBSP.

This case was reported in the literature.

The subject received the following suspect product:
Topiramate: 300 mg daily, for temporal lobe epilepsy. The drug was withdrawn.

The patient received the following concomitant product:
Carbamazepine.

The patient was treated with sildenafil.

A 48-year-old man had been receiving carbamazepine, and topiramate, which was titrated up to a dosage of 300 mg/day [route of administration not stated], for temporal lobe epilepsy. One month after initiating treatment, he developed erectile dysfunction. A moderate degree of seriousness was assigned to his erectile dysfunction based on the international index for erectile function. Sildenafil was initiated and his erectile dysfunction, intermittently, regressed. Topiramate was withdrawn and his erection problems subsequently resolved. 

The outcome of the event was reported as resolved at the time of this report.

The reporter considered the case serious because the ADR was medically significant.

Author Comment: ''Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, a class of drugs that may interfere with the production of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide (NO), two substances that perform a key role in the mechanisms surrounding erection . . . This hypothesis would also be supported by that [sic] fact that it responded to Sildenafil.


Duplicate report received on 07-NOV-2011.

4 July 2014 (Significant) A US FDA specific follow up has been added in the case as below.

Upon internal review, it was observed that the initial E2b report submitted to FDA had seriousness criteria marked as  Fatal even though none of the events reported in the case were associated with a fatal outcome. This was due to the fact that Autopsy Done field was auto populated as Unknown instead of Blank. This follow up is added to update the Autopsy done field from Unknown to Blank so that the correct seriousness criteria gets reflected in the E2b report for FDA.



Follow up report received on 27-MAR-2014 containing further information:
Reporter details.
Lab data.

Suspect product details:
Topiramate: 2.5 mg/week. The dose was increased up to 300 mg daily.

Concomitant product details:
Carbamazepine: 1200 mg, for temporal lobe epilepsy.

Treatment product details:
Sildenafil: 50 mg, on demand. The drug was withdrawn.

Reaction text updated: ""A 48-year-old patient with temporal lobe epilepsy since the age of 14 years suffered three to four complex partial seizures per month with rare secondary generalization. Brain MR showed left mesial temporal lobe sclerosis. The attacks were refractory to 1200 mg Carbamazepine (CBZ), thus TPM was added. The dosage was increased by 25 mg/week up to 300 mg daily, and the frequency of complex partial seizures decreased. One month after the maximal dosage intake, the patient started to complain about ED, characterized by the inability to maintain a full erection. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a validated questionnaire to assess male sexual function, was administered and it showed an erectile function (EF) domain score consistent with moderate erectile dysfunction (IIEF: EF domain score of 16). Subjective libido and sexual arousal were not affected. The patient denied a similar problem before. He was not on other drugs apart from AEDs. During TPM therapy, ED was temporarily abrogated upon intake of Sildenafil 50 mg on demand. After TPM discontinuation sexual function was completely restored within 2 weeks (IIEF: EF domain score of 28) without the need of Sildenafil. No affective or mood disorders emerged through clinical interview. The presence of depression and anxiety symptoms were excluded (Hamilton Rating Scales: HRS-D: 3; HRS-A: 2; cut-off value: >-11 to 11). The hepatic and renal functions were entirely normal. Sexual hormone serum levels, including LH, FSH, prolactin, progesterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DlEA-S), total, free and bioavailable testosterone [6], sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI) were evaluated before and several time intervals after the interruption of TPM, when erectile function was restored (Table 1). At 16 months follow up the patients is not complaining of any erectile failure (IIEF EF domain score of 28).""

Company comment:

The case is rated as serious and unexpected with Topiramate use. Similar cases have been reported in the literature. According to the author ""Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, a class of drugs that may interfere with the production of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide (NO), two substances that perform a key role in the mechanisms surrounding erection"" . In this case temporal association suggests a possible causality.

A 64-year-old male patient started to receive linezolid (ZYVOX, solution for infusion) intravenous drip 1200mg/day for multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) haemolyticus infection on 02Aug2010. Relevant history included cerebellar haemorrhage from 17Jun2010, bacterial meningitis on 23Jul2010, cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation,  hyperuricaemia and diabetes mellitus . The patient had no allergy. The patient underwent haematoma evacuation on 17Jul2010, and debridement on 27Jul2010.  Insulin was administered subcutaneously for diabetes mellitus as concomitant drug. The patient received piperacillin sodium (PENTCILLIN) 4 g/day from 17Jul2010 to 21Jul2010, propofol (DIPRIVAN) 300 mL/day from 18Jul2010 to 21Jul2010, omeprazole (OMEPRAL) 20 mg/day for haemorrhage prophylaxis from 20Jul2010 to 30Jul2010, imipenem hydrate/cilastatin sodium (TIENAM) 2 g/day for meningitis bacterial from 23Jul2010 to 27Jul2010 and vancomycin hydrochloride (VANCOMYCIN) 2 g/day for MRSA haemolyticus infection from 27Jul2010 to 02Aug2010. Vancomycin  was ineffective, so it was changed to linezolid. On 04Aug2010, he experienced haematuria, it was mild. On 05Aug2010 he developed myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. Blood examination was performed on 05Aug2010 because the patient's urine was red. Since aspartate aminotransferase (GOT), alanine aminotransferase (GPT),  blood urea (BUN), creatinine and creatine kinase increased, the neurosurgeon gave fluid infusion therapy together with dopamine to maintain renal blood flow as conservative treatment. The patient's urine volume decreased on 06Aug2010. Blood examination revealed increase of GOT, GPT, BUN creatinine and creatine kinase on 06Aug2010. The patient developed almost anuria in the night of 06Aug2010. The patient had continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) on 07Aug2010. Laboratory findings were as follows: GOT was 25IU/L on 29Jul2010, 647IU/L on 05Aug2010, 1357IU/L on 06Aug2010 and 1595IU/L on 07Aug2010. GPT was 18IU/L on 29Jul2010, 215IU/L on 05Aug2010, 479IU/L on 06Aug2010 and 747IU/L on 07Aug2010. BUN was 39.7mg/dL on 29Jul2010, 42.7mg/dL on 05Aug2010, 71.6mg/dL on 06Aug2010 and 114.1mg/dL on 07Aug2010. Creatinine was 1.2mg/dL on 29Jul2010, 1.0mg/dL on 05Aug2010, 1.9mg/dL on 06Aug2010 and 2.9mg/dL on 07Aug2010. Potassium was 3.6mEq/L on 29Jul2010, 4.0mEq/L on 05Aug2010, 5.6mEq/L on 06Aug2010 and 6.9mEq/L on 07Aug2010. Creatine kinase was 62IU/L on 23Jul2010, 43100IU/L on 05Aug2010, 112400IU/L on 06Aug2010 and 172600IU/L on 07Aug2010. The patient developed cardiac arrest and died of renal failure on [RED]. Autopsy was not performed. Linezolid therapy was stopped on 06Aug2010. Insulin was continued unchanged until his death. The events myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis, were assessed as ""life threatening"" by the reporting neurosurgeon. The patient did not recover from  myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis, at the time of death. Patient's causes of death were reported as haematuria and renal failure. The reporting pharmacist assessed the event haematuria as unrelated to linezolid with commenting as follows: brown discoloration was caused by blood in the urine. Therefore, it was no relationship between the event and linezolid. The neurosurgeon commented as follows: the patient was still in a bad condition when vancomycin hydrochloride was started. Vancomycin hydrochloride was ineffective, so that vancomycin hydrochloride was replaced with linezolid. Although linezolid was so effective that spinal fluid could come to be more clear, the patient died soon after administration of linezolid. The neurosurgeon referred that the causality with linezolid was low because the patient was suffering from meningitis which was complicated by sepsis.   Follow-up (24Aug2010): New information reported from a contactable neurosurgeon through a Pfizer sales representative includes: patient's medical history and past drug event, onset date of the adverse events, date of death and the cause of death was changed from all adverse events to renal failure, action taken with the suspect and the concomitant products and assessment of the reporting neurosurgeon about the adverse events myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure.  Follow-up (07Sep2010): New information reported from a contactable neurosurgeon through a Pfizer sales representative includes: the patient's date of birth, height and weight, initials, update of patient's medical history, past drug event and concomitant drugs, update of onset date of the adverse events, lab data, assessment of the reporting neurosurgeon.

In the meantime a physician has verified this report in parts.      On an unknown date in September 2010 the patient started retapamulin (topical) at an unknown dosing.      Immediate after using retapamulin for the first time, on an unknown date in September 2010, the patient experienced abnormal crying, gaze palsy and convulsive seizure.      This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK criteria.      After about on hour, on an unknown date in September 2010, the patient calmed down again and the events were resolved.      Follow-up information was received on 20 October 2010 from the reporting consumer.      On 27 September 2010 the patient started retapamulin (topical) twice per day.       Immediately post application of retapamulin for the first time, on 27 September 2010, the patient experienced crying in sheet terror due to pain (crying abnormal), gaze palsy, seizure-like movements towards the back, bright red skin all over the body (generalized erythema), hot face, tension in skin of face and toe cramps. These events were experienced for the first time.      This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK criteria.      Treatment included washing off of retapamulin ointment and application of a suppository. The events started to resolve and were completely resolved after about 90 minutes.      Treatment with retapamulin was discontinued. The patient was not rechallenged with retapamulin.      Follow-up information was received on 25 October 2010 and 27 October 2010 from the treating physician.      Concurrent medications included Vitamin D.   The patient has not received retapamulin previously.   The events resolved post discontinuation of treatment with retapamulin.   The patient received no treatment for the events.   The reporting physician did not know whether or not all events were completely resolved.      The reporting physician also provided the answers to a GSK questionnaire asking for additional information in cases of seizure:      The convulsion was witnessed by the patient's family at home.   It was unknown whether or not the event was preceded by an aura or headache.   It was unknown whether or not the symptoms had been generalized or focal.   It was unknown whether or not the patient did loose consciousness.    It was unknown whether or not the patient was disoriented and / or drowsy upon regaining consciousness.   It was unspecified whether the patient could recall the event because the patient was an infant.   It was unknown whether or not the patient did experience urinary or faecal incontinence during convulsive seizure.   There was no evidence that the symptoms may have resulted from withdrawal of alcohol or other psychotropic substances.      It was unknown whether or not follow-up of the event was performed because the family has moved.   The patient was given no driving restrictions.      None of the following events was known in medical history: seizures (including febrile seizures and epilepsy), movement disorders, other central nervous system (CNS) conditions including impairment of cerebral circulation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), psychiatric disorders et cetera, head injury, cerebral palsy, neurological handicap or congenital abnormality, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, alcohol or drug abuse.   The patient has not received medication which is known to reduce the seizure threshold.      No neurological examinations were performed because the suspected convulsive seizure was resolved and the physician has not seen and examined the patient for this event.   There was no known evidence of a neurological lesion or infection (encephalitis, meningitis) which might have been the cause of the seizure.    Serum electrolytes have not been determined.      On 27 October 2010 the physician has sent the same information again, but this time follow-up information was signed and stamped by the reporting physician.

His screening CD4 count was 455 and around the time of this event his CD4 count was 318.   Concomitant medication included allopurinol. Relevant medical history included markedly advanced degenerative joint disease of left knee joint, gout and is an active tobacco smoker. Past echocardiogram (from 2008) showed mild sclerosis, non-stenotic aortic valve disease, enlarged atrium, 1-2+ mitral regurgitation; enlarged right atrium with 1+ tricuspid regurgitation; concentric left ventricular hypertrophy which limits ejection fraction (EF) to 40-45%.    The patient had no history of any hypercoagulability disorder, no past history of thromboembolism (prior history of deep vein thrombosis was initially reported), and there was no indication that the patient had evidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. He did not have a history of recent travel, surgery, immobilization or trauma to his legs and there was no evidence of malignancies. The patient had no drug allergies.  On 08 August 2011, the patient was reportedly in his usual state of health except he had been experiencing right leg pain for the previous few days (no antecedent event was reported for the leg pain) and may have been slightly dehydrated.  While he was walking down the street with a friend, he suddenly felt lightheaded. After receiving assistance to a chair, he passed out. No focal weakness, numbness, seizure activity, or incontinence was noted; no prior history of seizure activity or black-outs was reported.  The patient was not cold or clammy. However, he did report some shortness of breath. Paramedics arrived and the patient's blood pressure was notably low (no value provided). He was transferred to the hospital and subsequently admitted. Upon examination in the emergency room (ER), the patient was alert and oriented, his right calf and lower extremity were tender, heart rate 132 bpm, blood pressure 114/66 mmHg and he was afebrile. Subsequently, while still in the ER, his blood pressure fell to 87/58 mmHg.  His oxygen saturation level was 100% on room air. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain did not show any changes since 2008. While in x-ray, the patient fell, sustaining a minor laceration that was treated without incident.  A CT scan of the spine revealed spondylosis but no fracture.  Laboratory tests indicated glucose 115, C-reactive protein (CPR) 3.0, sedimentation rate 49 and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 101.8 was elevated; no normal ranges or units were provided. Liver function tests of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were elevated; no values provided.     Admission venous Doppler ultrasound was done bilaterally and showed right lower extremity extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) involving the superficial, popliteal and calf veins and no left lower extremity DVT. A CT angiogram of the chest showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli including a saddle embolus and bullous disease in upper lobes (right greater than left).  The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Anticoagulant therapy with Lovenox was implemented. The patient's condition progressed without complication. He was discharged from the hospital on [RED] and the events were considered resolved.   The patient never initiated study medication Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.   The physician assessed the event as serious (life threatening, hospitalization) and, in follow up, not related to Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate  and not related to study procedure. His rationale for initially assessing these events as related was because the patient had no past medical history of thromboembolism and causality for study drug could not be ruled out.  It was later determined the patient never initiated study medication dispensed to him therefore causality was amended to not related. Alternative causality was study disease related.  Additional information received on 26 August 2011: Investigator confirmed event causality to remain as study drug related. No change made to the case narrative.   Additional information received on 30 August 2011: No medical history of thromboembolism per patient, Investigator causality rationale. Relevant information incorporated into the narrative.  Additional information received on 10 January 2012: Updated SAE Report Form and changes included causality to Not Related, action taken with study medication, alternative causality, concomitant medication, screening and recent CD4 counts, answered medical queries confirming no history of recent travel, surgery, immobilization, trauma or malignancy, no evidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

The patient's height and weight were not reported. The patient's medical history and concurrent conditions included acute myeloid leukemia, infective arthritis, deafness and cervix carcinoma. The patient was treated with doripenem (powder, intravenous drip) dose unspecified, initiated on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication. Concomitant medications included paracetamol, chlorphenamine maleate, metoclopramide, lansoprazole, carbocisteine, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, veen 3g, itraconazole and micafungin sodium. Since, the arthritis frequently occurred, on 23-JAN-2012, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) arthritis was suspected and a treatment with vancomycin (unspecified, intravenous drip) 1 g/ day was initiated for infective arthritis. On the same day, a laboratory investigation revealed serum Creatinine of 0.65 mg/dL, Uric acid of 2.2 mg/dL and Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 5 mg/ dL. The vancomycin, 1 g/ day was used until 26-JAN-2012 and on the same day, the vancomycin blood level was found to be 5.9 mcg/ mL and the dosage of vancomycin was increased to 2 g/ day on the same day. On 27-JAN-2012, the patient had developed pyrexia of 38.2 degree Celsius. Since, there was a person with influenza who contacted with the patient, a treatment with peramivir hydrate (unspecified, intravenous drip) 300 mg was administered for 1 day, for suspected influenza. The flu test was negative though. A laboratory test performed on the same day showed vancomycin blood level of 12.8 mcg/ mL, serum Creatinine of 0.86 mg/ dL, Uric acid of 4.6 mg/ dL and BUN of 12 mg/ dL. The patient had noticed decrease in urine volume and the infusion of fluids were started because of poor dietary intake until 29-JAN-2012. On 30-JAN-2012, the serum Creatinine level was 4.34 mg/dL, Uric acid was 8.4 mg/dL, BUN was 39 mg/dL and Creatinine clearance was 3 mL/min. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure and on the same day, treatment with vancomycin, 2 g/ day was used upto 30-JAN-2012 and hence vancomycin was withdrawn; and febuxostat, maintenance medium and sodium bicarbonate was started. On 31-JAN-2012, the patient had developed aggravated deafness and became almost deaf in the right ear. On the same day, the vancomycin blood level was 52.3 mcg/mL, serum Creatinine was 4.61 mg/ dL, Uric acid was 8.2 mg/ dL and BUN was 52 mg/ dL. On 02-FEB-2012, the values of serum Creatinine was 2.8 mg/ dL, uric acid was 6.3 mg/ dL, vancomycin blood level was 28.4 mcg/mL and BUN was 40 mg/dL respectively. Treatment with vancomycin was withdrawn, action taken with doripenem was not reported and action taken with other antivirals was not applicable. As on 02-FEB-2012, the patient had not recovered from the reported events. The pharmacist considered that the renal function decreased due to dehydration associated with pyrexia and the poor oral intake and also due to the increase in the blood level of vancomycin and peramivir hydrate. The pharmacist considered the causality between the events and peramivir hydrate to be related; and the causality assessment between the events and doripenem as not related. The pharmacist also stated that there were no causative factors other than the use of peramivir hydrate and vancomycin.   This report was serious (permanent disability, hospitalization).    Additional information was received from a pharmacist via Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), on 18-JUN-2012.  The patient's concurrent conditions included drug hypersensitivity. The patient had previously experienced deafness when taking cisplatin. Concomitant medications details were updated.

The patient was reportedly antiretroviral therapy naive before starting Complera and adherent to the treatment. The patient had not used a proton-pump inhibitor, H2-blocker or other antacid while on therapy with Complera.  Concomitant medications included INH, vitamin B6, nicotine patch, Bactrim DS and Valtrex. The patient's medical history included NNRTI mutations V179D and Y188L, latent tuberculosis (TB), herpes and tobacco use.   On 20 May 2011, Trugene genotyping assay revealed the following mutations V179D and Y188L. On 25 May 2011, samples were collected for reflexive test genotypic drug resistance. On 13 June 2011, the results for reflexive test for HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance revealed: for reverse transcriptase mutations V179D and Y188L, susceptibility was noted for abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine/emtricitabine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine, etravirine while resistance was noted for efavirenz and nevirapine (Y188L mutation). No relevant protease mutations were detected while no evidence of resistance was noted for atazanavir, atazanavir with ritonavir, darunavir with ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir with ritonavir, indinavir, indinavir with ritonavir, lopinavir with ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir with ritonavir and Tipranavir with ritonavir.   On 25 May 2011, Quantiferon TB gold test was performed and the patient tested positive. He also tested HIV + on Elisa and Western Blot. No pulmonary complaints were noted. Treatment (INH, Vitamin B6) for latent TB was started 30 September 2011.  On 23 September 2011, the patient's baseline laboratory results noted HIV RNA 55,700 copies/ml.  On 25 October 2011, the patient's HIV RNA had reduced to 2, 260 copies/ml.   However, the patient experienced virological failure.  On 02 February 2012, his HIV RNA had increased to 46, 200 copies/ml.   On 14 February 2012, the HIV RNA was 30,800 copies/ml and the Vircotype genotype assay was performed. The HIV virtual phenotyping interpretation revealed resistance susceptibility to Retrovir and Zerit, resistance was predicted for Ziagen, Videx, Epivir and Emtriva and intermediate resistance was predicted for Viread, in the Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) category. In the Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) category, resistance was predicted for Sustiva and Viramine while intermediate resistance was predicted for Intelence. In the protease inhibitor category susceptibility of resistance was predicted for fosamprenavir + ritonavir, indinavir + ritonavir, Viracept, saquinavir+ritonavir, Kaletra, atazanavir + ritonavir, tipranavir + ritonavir and Prezista.  The summary report for Vircotype HIV-1 resistance analysis of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase revealed NRTI/NtRTI mutations; 65R, 181C and 184V for Retrovir and Zerit showed maximal response, Epivir and Videx showed minimal response, Ziagen and Emtriva were resistant while Viread showed reduced response. NNRTI mutations 103R, 179D, 181C, and 188L were noted and showed resistance for Viramune and Sustiva/Stocrin and showed reduced response for Intelence while protease inhibitor mutations: 15V and 16E were noted with resistance susceptibility noted for Viracept while maximal response was noted for Crixivan, Invirase boosted, Lexiva, Tetzir boosted, Kaletra, Reyataz boosted, Aptivus boosted and Prezista boosted.   All mutation in the protease (PR) category were: 3I, 15V, 16E, 37N, 39S and 63H and in the reverse transcriptase (RT) category were; 60I, 65R, 103R, 122K, 139A, 142V, 162C, 177E, 179D, 181C, 184Y, 188L, 189WT/I, 197K, 200A, 272A, 277K, 286A, 288T, 334WT/R, 357T, 376A, 389WT/l and 390R.   On 06 March 2012, treatment with Complera was discontinued and the patient was switched to alternative antiretrovirals (not specified). It was stated that virological failure mutations were permanent and the event of virological failure persisted.   No further information was provided.  This was previously an invalid case and became a valid case on 08 March 2012.

This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence
of adrenal cortex hypofunction in a 14-year-old male patient who received
Fluticasone propionate (Flutide diskus) inhaler for asthma. 





Concurrent medical conditions included allergic rhinitis and asthma.
Co-suspect medication included Flunase (Japan). Concurrent medications
included beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclometasone). 





The patient had been on fluticasone inhaler (a maximum dose of 1000 mcg/day)
for bronchial asthma since the age of 10, and on fluticasone nasal drops (50
mcg/day) for allergic rhinitis since the age of 13. Subsequently,
beclometasone nasal drops (50 mcg/day) had been administered.





On an unknown date the patient visited the reporting hospital for failure to
thrive (decreased growth rate) (4:1 cm/year). Stature at 147.8 cm (-2.2
standard deviation through the survey in 14 hospital(SD)) and weight at
35.0kg (-1.8 SD) were noted, and degree of obesity was -9.8%. Other test
included the following: testis capacity, 12 mL; external genitals, Tanner
stage 3; insulin-like growth factor (IGF), 1349 ng/mL; luteinizing hormone
(LH), 2.1 mIU/ml; follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 4.7 mIU/mL;
testosterone, 4.37 ng/mL; and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), 40
mcg/dL. On an unknown date corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) tolerance
test revealed  low response with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (pg/mL)
of 15.2 to 54.0 and cortisol (mcg/dL) of 6.1 to 14.2. No Cushing sign was
noted. The patient was diagnosed with adrenal cortex hypofunction triggered
by failure to thrive (decreased growth rate).





The physician considered the events to be clinically significant (or
requiring intervention). At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events
was unknown.





The literature article corresponding to this case is not available for
regulatory reporting submission due to copy right restriction.





Follow up information received on 15 October 2012:


This case refers to a 11 year old male patient and not a 14 year old male
patient as previously reported. 





Co-suspect medications also included budesonide (Rhinocort). 


Concomitant medication beclometasone has been removed. 





In 2009, at an unknown time after receiving fluticasone, the patient
developed adrenal cortex hypofunction and failure to thrive. At the time of
reporting, the outcome of the events was unresolved. 





The reporter considered that the events were related to fluticasone and the
other suspect drug.





The literature article corresponding to this case is not available for
regulatory reporting submission due to copy right restriction.





Follow-up information was received on 25 October 2012:


[Reporter's comment]


Additive or synergetic effects of Flunase (fluticasone propionate) could not
be ruled out.


It was unknown whether the patient could reach the final adult height in case
Flutide (fluticasone propionate) had not been used. If the patient had been
exposed to stress without noticing adrenal suppression, the patient's
condition could have resulted in adrenal insufficiency. Based on the above
mentioned points, the symptoms were considered to be dangerous adverse drug
reactions.

This case report from CANADA was derived from medical literature on 03-MAY-2013 , article entitled ""Venous thromboembolism due to suspected interaction between rivaroxaban and nevirapine."". It refers to a 60-year-old male patient who received RIVAROXABAN for anticoagulation and NEVIRAPINE for HIV infection and experienced left-sided deep vein thrombosis in the external iliac and common femoral veins,, clinical signs of pulmonary embolism, subtherapeutic anticoagulation, and drug drug interaction between Nevirapine and Rivaroxaban. Case report. A 60-year-old man was admitted to hospital for total knee replacement. The patient's medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular accident of the right middle cerebral artery, osteoarthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia and polyneuropathy and HIV infection. The HIV infection had been diagnosed 8 years before the current admission (viral load 270 000 copies/mL; CD4 nadir 0.266 10^9/L [normal range 0.499 10^9 to 1.651 10^9/L]), but the patient had never had an AIDS-defining illness. The patient had no prior history of VTE and no known drug allergies. His body weight was 61.1 kg. Medications before admission were nevirapine 400 mg daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, amlodipine 10 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg daily, gabapentin 300 mg 3 times daily, and lamotrigine 50 mg twice daily. The only change to the medication regimen in the past 2 years had been the discontinuation, about 3 weeks before admission, of abacavir 600 mg/lamivudine 300 mg because of intolerance and replacement with lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg. At the time of the change in antiretroviral therapy, the patient had a viral load of less than 40 copies/mL and a CD4 count of 0.392 10^9/L, which suggested a good virological response to therapy. The patient received dalteparin 2500 units subcutaneously (SC) 6 h after the knee replacement surgery and then dalteparin 5000 units SC on postoperative days 1 and 2. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily was started on postoperative day 3, at which time the patient was discharged from hospital; there were no other changes to the patients home medication regimen. At the time of discharge, the patient had no symptoms of VTE. On postoperative day 4 (after 2 doses of rivaroxaban) the patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, chest pain, and swelling of the left leg. He was hemodynamically stable, with oxygen saturation of 93% on room air and temperature 38.3 C. The only abnormalities noted on physical examination were a grade 2/6 systolic murmur and jugular venous pressure of 1- 2 cm above the sternal angle. The left leg was warm and swollen, but no erythema or discharge was noted around the surgical site. The results of laboratory tests at the time of this admission included hemoglobin 100 g/L (normal range 137- 180 g/L), platelet count 139- 109/L (normal range 150 109/L to 400 109/L), white blood cell count 4.9 109/L (normal range 4 109/L to 11 109/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 (normal range 0.9- 1.1), activated partial thromboplastin time 25.4 s (normal range 25 35 s), serum creatinine 107 mol/L (normal range 50- 120 mol/L), and an estimated creatinine clearance of 57 mL/min (according to the Cockcroft Gault formula). The results of liver function tests were total bilirubin 8 mol/L (normal range 0- 24 mol/L), alanine aminotransferase 74 U/L (normal range 1- 60 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 74 U/L (normal range 30- 145 U/L), and glutamyl transferase 15 U/L (normal range 11- 63 U/L). Elevation of D-dimer (3.44 mg/L FEU [fibrinogen equivalent units]; normal range 0.46 mg/L FEU) and troponin T (21 ng/L; normal range 1- 14 ng/L) were noted. Contrastenhanced computed tomography of the lower legs and chest revealed a left-sided deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the external iliac and common femoral veins, but the image was nondiagnostic for pulmonary embolism. There was no radiologic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. The results of blood, urine, and sputum culture were all negative. Electrocardiography displayed sinus tachycardia and lateral ST-T wave abnormalities. In the emergency department, oxygen was started at 3 L/min, along with unfractionated heparin (80 unit/kg bolus, followed by infusion of 18 units/kg per hour) and warfarin. The rivaroxaban was stopped, and all other home medications were continued. On postoperative day 5, the heparin was switched to tinzaparin 10 700 units (175 units/kg) SC daily; at this point, the chest pain had resolved. On postoperative day 7, the oxygen was discontinued. As well, the only abnormality seen on transthoracic echocardiography was trace mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation; the size and function of the left and right ventricles were normal. On postoperative day 9, the patient was discharged with prescriptions for warfarin (INR 3) and tinzaparin and was to be followed by Anticoagulation Management Services for INR monitoring. On postoperative day 10, the tinzaparin was discontinued (INR 2.5). On postoperative day 24 (INR 2.2), Anticoagulation Management Services transferred warfarin management to the family physician. The patient was stabilized with warfarin therapy as follows: 4 mg on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday and 5 mg on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Author's comment: In the case reported here, a patient presented to hospital 24 h after discharge (following an admission for total knee replacement) with DVT and clinical signs of pulmonary embolism, specifically dyspnea, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated troponin T. Postoperatively and before the re-admission, the patient had received a short course of dalteparin followed by 2 doses of rivaroxaban 10 mg daily. Although the patient's HIV positive status may have been a factor in the early presentation of VTE, concurrent nevirapine may have further increased the elevated hepatic clearance of rivaroxaban through induction of isozyme CYP3A4, leading to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. To the authors knowledge, this is the first report of a potential drug interaction between nevirapine and rivaroxaban.

This report was serious (hospitalization, medically significant).



Additional information was received from a physician on 20-MAY-2013.

It was reported that nevirapine as a strong inducer of isoenzyme CYP3A4,  suggesting that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentration of rivaroxaban. The patient had received nevirapine for years, so maximal enzyme induction of CYP3A4 was already present. The half life of rivaroxaban levels potentially reached steady state with in 48 hour of starting rivaroxaban therapy. The patient was going to continue anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 months. The patient had a very good virologic response to therapy with nevirapine, lamivudine, zidovudine defined as viral load less than 50 copies/mL, as well as reasonable tolerability. The risk of VTE in the HIV population was approximately 2 to 10 fold greater than in general population. The reporter contact details were updated.



Follow up information was received on 04-JUN-2013. The report contains no new information and no changes were made to the report.

decreased from 1 20g/L to 102 g/L. Three weeks later, repeat testing showed a
red blood cell count of 3.00 ?10e12/L and hemoglobin level of 81 g/L.
Lamivudine was discontinued and his treatment was switched to entecavir 0.5
mg once daily while other medications remained unchanged. After 16 days, a
repeat routine blood test showed a red blood cell count of 3.84?10e12/L and a
hemoglobin level of 120 g/L. At the time of reporting, the events were
improved.





The author considered the events were related to treatment with
lamivudine-HBV.

Follow up received on 26 May 2013:


The patient was hospitalized on [RED] for fatigue, poor appetite,
nausea, progressive aggravation of juandice of skin and sclera for 10 days. 4
years ago, the patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatits B at our hospital
and given intermittent oral hepatoprotective treatment without antiviral
treatment with interferon and nucleoside (nucleotide) analogs. The physical
examination showed T = 36.5 degrees C, P = 72 beats/minute, R = 18
breaths/minute, BP = 120/80 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), clear consciousness,
adequate spirits, severe jaundice of skin and sclera. The laboratory
examination showed WBC = 4.8x10^9/L, NEU = 3.5x10^9/L, LYM = 1.1 x10^9/L, RBC
= 4.52 x10^12/L, PLT = 128 x10^9/L, HGB = 120 g/L, ALT = 1296 U/L, AST = 598

The patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic severe hepatitis B. The
patient was given oral lamivudine 100 mg qd, oral silibinin 70 mg tid,
intravenous reduced glutathione 1.2 g qd, intravenous compound glycyrhizin 80
ml qd and intravenous HGPF 120 mg qd. The laboratory examination on 20 April
showed HGB = 102 g/L, RBC = 3.29x10^9/L, WBC = 10.2x10^9/L, NEU = 6.1x10^9/L,
LYM = 3.3x10^9/L, PLT = 128x10^9/L. The laboratory examination on 4 May
showed HGB = 81 g/L, RBC = 3.00x10^12/L, WBC = 4.0x10^9/L, NEU = 1.9x10^9/L,
LYM = 1.6x10^9/L, PLT = 161x10^9/L, RET = 0.005, SI = 20.5umol/L, SVB12 =

175x10^9/L. The patient was discharged and continued on oral silibinin and
entecavir. The laboratory examination 3 months later showed HGB = 122 g/L,
RBC = 4.52x10^12/L, WBC = 6.2x10^9/L, NUE = 4.1x10^9/L, LYM = 2.0x10^9/L, PLT
= 186 x10^9/L, normal liver function, HBV DNA < 5x10^2 copies/ml. 





The author stated ""In this case, one week after use of lamivudine, the red
blood cell count and hemoglobin level increased and the changes in white
blood cell count and platelet count were not significant. 3 weeks later, the
routine blood test showed low reticulocyte count and the bone marrow biopsy
showed decreased nucleated cell count. The auxiliary examination ruled out
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia and nutritional anemia.
Lamivudine was discontinued and the patient was switched to entecavir for
antiviral treatment. 2 weeks later, the red blood cell count and hemoglobin
level returned to normal, suggesting anemia is closely associated with
lamivudine-induced myelosuppression""

No information given on patient's history, past drugs, concomitant medication and concurrent conditions.
 
On 27-JUN-2013 the patient received GADAVIST (gadobutrol) at 8 ml, once for MRI of CNS (magnetic resonance imaging of central nervous system). GADAVIST was used previously twice and no issues were reported. Lot number and expiration date were not provided.

On 27-JUN-2013 the patient experienced SOME ANAPHALAXIS REQUIRING RESPIRATORY SUPPORT and HIVES. The outcome of the events was recovering.

No reporter causality was provided for GADAVIST.

Internal correspondence (05-Sep-2013): Despite multiple attempts to contact the health care professional, no further information was obtained.

Correction (10-JAN-2014) : 
After an internal review, it was identified that the dose for Gadavist previously reported as 8ml should be 0.8ml.

Follow up received on 01-Dec-2014 from health care professional (the primary reporter of this case). It was confirmed that the case 2013-154519, initially received from health authority, is a duplicate of this case. All information received in that case and previously distributed on 17-Dec-2013 and 17-Nov-2014 was updated below:

On 17-Dec-2013, a report was received from health authority (case# 516342) and additional information was received from the primary reporter on 17-Nov-2014. 

The patient initials were updated.

The patient's concurrent conditions included meningitis and empyema. The patient's medical history included: normal renal function and no historical of allergies, asthma and past drug reactions.  It was also reported that the patient had been previously exposed to contrast (not further specified) on 03-Jun-2013, 07-Jun-2013, and 13-Jun-2013 with no reactions to that contrast.

The patient received the following concomitant medication: Precedex and Versed.  Versed was considered as co-suspected drug, based on information provided by reporter regarding the assessment of event.

On 27-Jun-2013, after 30 minutes of scanning, the patient was sedated and received GADAVIST for follow up for new neurologic changes due to meningitis.  The power injector was not used, but the line was flushed. The injection rate was reported as 1ml/sec, a peripherally inserted Central Catheter was used. The procedures performed were MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography).

Upon completion of the post contrast imaging, the patient was removed from the scanner. About 20 to 25 minutes after receiving the contrast the patient experienced rash, then began having difficulty breathing.  The patient experienced hives on the torso, severe wheezing and respiratory failure. The patient was treated and stabilized. De-challenge was reported by the regulatory authority as positive and the re-challenge was not applicable. 
Hives on torso, severe wheezing and respiratory failure were reported as being life-threatening condition by health authority. 

So code response was called and the patient was admitted to pediatric Intensive care Unit (PICU).  The patient was hospitalized and it was unknown the duration of symptoms. The relationship between RASH and DIFFICULTY BREATHING and GADAVIST was reported as unknown, since according to health care professional, he also received Versed intravenous.

A neurologist provided a TOUCH re-authorization form to report that an adult male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis since 11 Feb 2008 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy experienced malignancy (onset unknown).  The event of malignancy is resolved. The causality for the event of malignancy is unknown. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated the patient received 69 infusions of TYSABRI from 11 Feb 2008 until 12 Jul 2013. TYSABRI therapy continues.

Update 06 Aug 2013: The neurologist returned an outbound phone call to report the patient had surgery for esophageal cancer (onset unknown) sometime in mid-2013 with good results. Despite the patient being JC antibody positive he would like to continue with TYSABRI therapy due to the positive response that has changed his life. The neurologist had no further details regarding the surgery and referred to the surgeon for further contact.

Update 08 Nov 2013: The neurologist provided a TOUCH MS discontinuation form reporting the patient tested positive for JCV antibody in Oct 2013. TYSABRI therapy has been permanently discontinued (per TOUCH database, last dose was administered on 14 Oct 2013).

A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  46 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from Jun 2010 to 16 Dec 2013 experienced suspect PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) (onset Jan 2014).  Approximately 20 days prior to reporting the patient presented with auditory hallucination. The event did not require hospitalisation. A lumbar puncture was scheduled for 04 Feb 2014 and CSF samples was to be sent for JCV analysis. The patient had received 37 TYSABRI infusions at the time of event onset. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 03 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. Per clinical report: the patient's MS onset was in 1990 with right eye optic neuritis and oral fissure deviation. A MRI showed a demyelinating leukoencephalopathy while a CSF test resulted negative. Previous MS medication included IFN beta 1 a therapy (presumed AVONEX) due to several clinical relapses (onsets Apr 1999) which was discontinued in Apr 2000 due to both clinical and neuroradiologic inefficacy. She received glatiramer acetate therapy from Oct 2002 due to several clinical relapses (onset 2001-2002) and discontinued in Sep 2004 due to both clinical and radiologic inefficacy. In Oct 2004 she started azathioprine therapy, discontinued in June 2005 due to persistent clinical and radiologic activity. In Jul 2005 the patient received the first mitoxantrone infusion to an unknown date. In Apr 2006 glatiramer acetate therapy was resumed due to the clinical and radiological stabilization gained with mitoxantrone therapy (6 infusions, cumulative total dose 48 mg/mq). Glatiramer acetate therapy was discontinued in July 2010 due to clinical and radiological activity (lesion burden increase and lesions in active phase). The patient was switched to TYSABRI in Aug 2010 which led to EDSS score and MRI picture stabilization. On 23 Mar 2011 the patient tested positive for JCV Abs detection. In July 2011 she underwent a cortisone cycle due to a clinical worsening (presume of MS) featured by a significant fatigue (onset unknown; presume Jul 2011, outcome and causality not reported). An MRI on 26 Sep 2013 showed a stable lesional burden without lesions in active phase.

 In Jan 2014 the patient presented a likely epileptic episode, featured by auditory hallucination (she reported she heard a kind of hurricane noise) followed by disorientation for some hours. A neurological examination on 29 Jan 2014 noted: well performed the ""stretch arms"" and ""finger to nose"" tests; the patient can lift up her right lower limb in 40 degrees, the left one in 5-10 degrees, the left heel-knee test was not assessable, difficult on the right, mild left lower limb hypertone, Romberg test resulted positive, paraparetic deambulation, bilateral steppage gait (more on the left then on the right), possible through costant aid for 20 meters. EDSS=6.5. On 31 Jan 2014 a brain MRI was performed (with and without contrast medium administration) which, when compared to a previous exam on 26 Sep 2013, showed bihemispheric fronto-temporal-parietal, cerebellar and brainstem multiple demyelinating areas, unchanged in number and size. By the way a wide signal alteration area appeared, hyperintense in FLAIR, involving the right temporal-occipital junction and, although the above mentioned limits a mild enhancement after contrast medium administration was recognized, like it was a blood brain barrier damage. The circonvolutions in this area resulted swollen with a consequent subarachnoid spaces occlusion. These findings could be compatible, if confirmed by a clinical picture, with a PML diagnosis. A very close follow up is needed in order to follow its evolution. Supratentorial and subtentorial ventricular system showed a discrete increase in size. The event outcome was not reported. Causality was not assessed. The last TYSABRI infusion was administered on 16 Dec 2013.

Update 12 Feb 2014: This case was received from the Italian regulatory agency via the National Pharmacovigilance Network (regulatory reference number: 237462). The patient's initials were updated. It was clarified that the patient had started TYSABRI treatment on 01 Aug 2010 (discrepant from previous report of Jun 2010). Concomitant medication included Lioresal (baclofen) for 6 years from 01 Dec 2007 and Efexor (venlafaxine) for 8 years from 01 Apr 2005. Causality between the event of suspect PML and TYSABRI was assessed as probable. A CSF sample was drawn on 04 Feb 2014 and the results were pending.

Update 17 Feb 2014: The neurologist reported that the results of CSF JCV DNA testing, performed at NIH laboratory, had returned positive for JCV DNA at 330 copies/ml

Update 19 Feb 2014: Upon internal expert panel review, this case was considered confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and MRI.

Update 19 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data Collection Tool. The patient tested negative for anti-Natalizumab antibodies on 23 Feb 2011. Serum anti-JCV antibody status on 24 Mar 2011 was positive.  The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores as follows: on 26 Jul 2010 (prior to TYSABRl) to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 7; on 25 Sep 2013 (on TYSABRl, prior to PML) to be 60 and 6.5; and on 31 Jan 2014 (at time of PML diagnosis) to be 60 and 6.5. An MRI was performed on 26 Sep 2013 and on 31 Jan 2014 (previously reported). A lumbar puncture was performed on 31 Jan 2014 and was positive for CSF JCV DNA at 330 copies per mL. Currently, the patient is alive and residing at home. She has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Update 21 Feb 2014:  An update was received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network (registry number 237462).  The patient is alive.  In addition to PML (onset 10 Jan 2014) the patient reported a single episode of auditory hallucination (onset 10 Jan 2014) of probable epileptic origin.  The patient's anti-JCV antibody status was tested via STRATIFY.  The patient did not report any malignancies or relapses (presumed MS) since her ""last visit"" (date of last visit not reported).  On 31 Jan 2014 the patient had an MRI (results previously reported), the patient's EDSS was 6.5 (previously reported), and the white blood cell count (WBC) was in ""normal range"".  The patient did not report any pregnancies.

Update 03 Mar 2014:  Upon follow-up it was determined that the patient was enrolled as a subject in the ""TYSABRl Observational Program (IMA-06-02)"".  Per the study investigator, the subject started TYSABRl on 28 Aug 2010 and the last infusion was administered on 13 Dec 2013 (dates discrepant).  The subject was diagnosed with MS on 01 Jan 1990 (date discrepant).  The event of PML, characterized by a single episode of auditory hallucination of epilectic origin, and a new large area in the T-O right lobe with enhancement suggestive of PML was assessed as severe.  The investigator considered the event related to TYSABRl.

Update 19 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via the MS Standardized PML Data Collection Tool and a diagnostic report. The patient is alive, is currently in the hospital, and is not on any MS therapy. The physician reported the patient has left hemiplegia, left lateral homonymous hemianopia, and is bedridden. She is alert, cooperative, and is sometimes confused. She has ideo-motor slowing. She reported a fracture of the right femur following an accidental fall (date unspecified). She has dysphagia and paroxysmal trigeminal pain. The physician assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 12 Jun 2014 to be 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 17 Apr 2014 (results not reported) and on 20 May 2014 with results reported as follows: compared to the previous exam performed on 17 Apr 2014, the current one shows a decrease of the mass effect and a decrease of the edema of the wide right subcortical hemispheric area of signal alteration, along with a significant decrease of the contrastographic enhancing areas and a restricted diffusion, still persists, punctiform, in the right parietal subcortical area. The swelling of the involved circonvolutions resulted reduced and the median line resulted on axis. The multifocal leucoencephalopathy picture, confluent, of the left hemisphere and the brainstem/cerebellum, resulted unchanged without any sign of contrast enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included the following: seizures (absences, partial, and status epilepticus at EEG) with onset date of 28 Feb 2014, cognitive/ behavioral (ideo-motor slowing, confusion, drowsiness), motor (left hemiplegia), and visual symptoms (left lateral homonymous hemianopia) with an onset date of 29 Mar 2014. The following medications were administered as treatment for IRIS: Maraviroc 30 mg PO BID since 07 Apr 2014, methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from 03 Apr to 21 May 2014, Synacthen Depot 1 mg IV daily from 21 May to 06 Jun 2014, and Keppra (levetiracetam) 1500 mg PO BID since 28 Feb 2014. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Update 15 Sep 2014:  The following report was received from literature.  Spadaro M, Marnetto F, Caldano M, Lugaresi A, and Bertolotto A.  Effect of natalizumab treatment on circulating CD4+CD62L+ T-cells in multiple sclerosis patients.  Presented at 30th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Mutliple Sclerosis; P968.  Four months after natalizumab withdrawal, and under steroid treatment, the patient's CD62L expression was 30.48% (date of testing and reference ranges not reported).

Update 09 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via the MS Standardized PML Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 28 Nov 2014 to be 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 7.5 to 8.0, respectively. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 06 Nov 2014 (results not provided). As of 24 Sep 2014, the patient has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the event of IRIS to TYSABRI was not assessed. The reporter noted that it was difficult to distinguish PML from IRIS outcome.

Update 23 Feb 2015:  Gerevini S, Caliendo G, Cava M, Capra R, De Rossi N, Falini A, and Cosottini M.  Natalizumab related PML:  Atypical neuroradiological findings.  Presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Congress of Radiology (ECR); Vienna Austria.  03 Mar 2015.  Eighteen patients with suspected PML lesions were sampled.  Three radiologic patters were defined:  anergic, mainly white matter non-enhancing lesions, inflammatory white matter lesions with punctate or curvilinear enhancement and atypical.  Lesions prevail in the left frontal lobe.  Focal lesions involved the subcortical WM in 16 patients, the deep WM in 10 and the grey matter 8 cases. PML lesions were hypointense on T1w and hyperintense on DWI in 14 pts. All patients have hyperintense lesions on T2w images. Focal lesions enhanced in 5 cases. At the beginning of the disease pattern A was observed in 3 patients and pattern B in 3 cases. The ""atypical pattern"" with cortical involvement was detected in 9 patients and with ""milky way sign"" in 5.",07/1/2011,FALL;MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS;PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY;EPILEPTIC FIT;FEMUR FRACTURE;IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME,EPILEPSY;MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS;PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY;FALL;IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME;FEMUR FRACTURE,NON-SITE SPECIFIC INJURIES NEC;MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ACUTE AND PROGRESSIVE;LIMB FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS;IMMUNE AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS NEC;POLYOMAVIRUS INFECTIONS;SEIZURES AND SEIZURE DISORDERS NEC,BONE AND JOINT INJURIES;IMMUNE DISORDERS NEC;SEIZURES (INCL SUBTYPES);VIRAL INFECTIOUS DISORDERS;INJURIES NEC;DEMYELINATING DISORDERS,"INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS;IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS;NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS;INJURY, POISONING AND PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS",,PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY,01/10/2014,IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME,02/28/2014,EPILEPSY,01/2014,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,07/2011,FALL,,FEMUR FRACTURE,,,,,,,Y,OT,TYSABRI(PS),NATALIZUMAB(PS),NATALIZUMAB(PS),TYSABRI:EFEXOR:LIORESAL:CORTISONE,CORTISONE:EFEXOR:LIORESAL,TYSABRI,NATALIZUMAB,,,,PS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CORTISONE,CORTISONE\HYDROCORTISONE,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LIORESAL,BACLOFEN,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EFFEXOR,VENLAFAXINE HYDROCHLORIDE,,,,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrent medical conditions included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Past medical history was not reported. The patient was not taking medications concomitantly.

On 10-Jan-2014, Omnipaque 300 mgI/mL administration was attempted for the imaging procedure at the other hospital but the CT scan was cancelled because approximately 10 mL of the contrast agent leaked to the outside of the vessel.

On 11-Jan-2014, pyrexia developed (temperature readings not reported).
On 13-Jan-2014, skin eruption with erythema developed in several sites of her limbs.
On [RED], the patient was referred and admitted to the reporting hospital since the pyrexia had persisted for approximately three weeks. Despite examinations were performed and initially suspecting lymphoma and sarcoidosis because enlarged lymph nodes were noted, these diseases were not present in the patient.

The symptoms of pyrexia resolved in thirty-three days and skin eruption resolved in thirty-one days. The outcome of diapedesis, delayed drug-induced allergy and erythema was unknown to the reporter.

Further information has been requested.

Follow-up information received on 25-Dec-2014:

Case information was amended as follows:
It was confirmed that adverse event, initially reported as pyrexia (inpatient hospitalization) and skin eruption (inpatient hospitalization), was delayed allergy (inpatient hospitalization), extravasation (non-serious) and swelling (non-serious).

Since Sep-2013, fatigueability when doing housework and farm work had been noted, but no other symptoms had developed.
On 08-Jan-2014, health screening showed hilar lymphadenopathy.
On 10-Jan-2014, the patient visited Hospital A, and contrast enhanced CT was planned to be performed. However, it was not performed due to contrast agent leak. Temporarily, swelling of the right forearm where contrast agent leaked was noted, but it disappeared on the following day.
On 11-Jan-2014, pyrexia appeared.
On 12-Jan-2014, body temperature increased to 38.4 degrees Celsius. Malaise became severe, and the patient got to spend all the day on the bed except to do housework.
Around the time, 2 or 3 cm induration with redness on the forearms and the left calf appeared, and skin biopsy was performed at the department of dermatology at Hospital A. The patient noticed muscle-tightness-like pain from the posterior cervical region to the occipital region.
On 17-Jan-2014, positron emission tomography (PET) showed generalised lymphadenopathy.
On [RED], the patient was hospitalized for detailed examinations of generalised lymphadenopathy.

Body temperature tended to decrease after peaking in 38.4 degrees Celsius which was noted on 12-Jan-2014. The patient's normal body temperature was 35 degrees Celsius, but fever of 36.0 to 37.0 degrees Celsius had been continued for a while. From early Feb, the patient maintained normal body temperature. Night sweats was not noted, but the patient lost 2 kg of weight in a month. Malaise improved along with pyrexia. The patient did not get to spend all the day on the bed. The patient was getting her appetite back, and dietary intake recovered from around 30% to around 70%. At this time, dry cough which had developed around for ten days remained.

Concomitant medications included Hochuekkito, Enalapril, and sitagliptin phosphate (Januvia).  Additional current medical history included alcohol use and past medical history included caesarean section and infantile asthma.

Outcome of delayed allergy was recovering as of 14-Feb-2014, outcome of swelling was recoverd on 10-Feb-2014, and outcome of extravasation was unknown at the time of the report.
Reporter's assessment of causality: 
Delayed allergy: related
Swelling: unknown
Extravasation: unknown
